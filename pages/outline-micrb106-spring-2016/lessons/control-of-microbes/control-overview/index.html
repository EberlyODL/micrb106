<h2>Chemical and Physical Control of Microorganisms</h2>
<p>Once it was determined that microorganisms exist and they are capable of causing disease, the medical community scrambled to devise ways to control the presence and growth of these organisms. Beginning with routine hand washing to sanitation to aseptic surgical techniques, the science of microbial control dominates our lives. We have all sorts of&nbsp;odd ideas&nbsp;about what is free of microbes and what is not.</p>
<p><strong>Sterilization</strong>&nbsp;is a term used to describe the destruction of all organisms in or on something. This includes all organisms on a surface or in a fluid. It can be surprisingly difficult to acheive true sterilization.&nbsp;<strong>Disinfection</strong>&nbsp;then is used to describe a process that leads to the reduction of&nbsp;<strong>Pathogens</strong>&nbsp;to harmless levels. Note it does not imply that something has been sterilized, merely no longer capable of causing disease. (there is a difference) A Pathogen is an organism that&#39;s capable of causing disease.</p>
<p>Other terms that refer to a state of disinfection&nbsp;are commonly used. An&nbsp;<strong>Antiseptic</strong>&nbsp;is a chemical that is used externally on tissues to destroy OR inhibit the growth of microorganisms. A&nbsp;<strong>Disinfectant</strong>&nbsp;is a chemical that tends to be too harsh to use on tissues and is generally reserved for cleaning surfaces. It won&#39;t however destroy spores that may be present. An antiseptic like Hydrogen Peroxide will effectively clean a cut but it will cause moderate tissue damage. That&#39;s why it stings. A disinfectant like Bleach will also effectively clean a cut but it will sting just a bit more... Neither substance would be effective for internal use, that&#39;s why we don&#39;t gargle it to help a sore throat. <strong>Sanitization</strong>&nbsp;is used to describe the process of removing microorganisms to reduce contamination to safe levels. This term is most often used by the food industry and in medicine to describe something that&#39;s "clean".</p>

<h3>Antibiotics Affecting Protein Synthesis</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.6em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1.2em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ">The aminoglycosides include <strong>Streptomycin</strong> which disrupts protein synthesis by causing a misreading of the bacterial mRNA. The wrong amino acids are placed in the chain leading to defective enzymes and proteins. Some of these proteins are membrane proteins and the defective shape actually allows more of the antibiotic to enter the cell.&nbsp;</p>

New amino acids cannot be added to the chain, thus blocking protein synthesis. Tetracycline only works on metabolically active cells so like most protein inhibitors here, it&#39;s a bacteriostatic drug. While not toxic there are some side effects including the destruction of the normal flora. Extended use can lead to opportunistic pathogens gettigng out of hand. It also is deposited in calcified tissues like bone and teeth. This can happen to children causing the teeth to be stained. Finally, tetracycline causes photosensitivity which means it&#39;s very easy to get a sunburn so caution is needed when outside.&nbsp;</p>

While not as effective as penicillin this is a good alternative for those allergic to penicillin. It is often used for repiratory tract infections.&nbsp;</p>

This is an older drug and due to resistant strains of bacteria it is not used much anymore in developed countries. It also has some toxic affects at high concentrations, causing anemia and even leukemia in cases of long term use. Here we tend to only use chloramphenicol in topical creams. However, in the developing world, it is still commonly used because it is very cheap and readily available.&nbsp;</p>

It works best on gram positive cells as it has trouble penetrating cell membranes and gram negative cells have two. Interestingly, being a very red colored drug, it will impart an orange color to a patient&#39;s urine and even sweat. This is quite harmless but noticable.&nbsp;</p>

The result is fragmentation of the DNA. These drugs are most often used in cases of hospital acquired or nosocomial infections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metabolic antagonists (competitive inhibitors) have a structure similar to natural substrate of an enzyme. They can attach to enzyme&#39;s active site to prevent or alter its normal function. One drug in this category is particularly interesting since it takes advantage of a unique metabolic feature of humans. The <strong>Sulfonamides</strong> are a set of antibiotics that interferes with the ability of a bacterial cell to produce folic acid. These drugs look alot like a precursor (p-aminobenzoic acid or PABA) that the cell use to produce folic acid, an essential item the cell needs to make DNA, RNA and amino acids.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The enzyme that produces folic acid tries to use PABA in the manufacture process but it sometimes grabs a molecule of the sulfonamide which won&#39;t work. The enzyme wastes its time on the wrong thing and as a result, the bacterial cell does not get enough folic acid and it dies. This does no affect humans in any way as we lack the metabolic machinery to create folic acid. We get all we need in our diet so for us, there is no enzyme to inhibit, the drug is harmless. These drugs were in wide use even before penicillin but they cause severe allergic reactions in some people and they&#39;re not widely used much anymore.&nbsp;</p>

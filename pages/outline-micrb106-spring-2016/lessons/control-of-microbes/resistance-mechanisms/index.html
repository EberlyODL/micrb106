<p>Bacteria have available a number of strategies to avoid the effects of an antibiotic. Gene mutations lead to protein shape changes that will no longer interact with the antibiotics. In some cases bacteria attack the antibiotic itself. Below are listed some of the main mechanisms for antibiotic resistance.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Attack the Antibiotic</h3>
<p>Antibiotics are organic molecules that have a specific shape and function. Some enzymes can directly degrade the structure of antibiotic molecules. For example, Penicillin has a dual ring structure called a beta lactam ring. A beta lactamase enzyme destroys this ring structure, rendering it useless. Just as antibiotics attack bacterial structures, certain enzymes can destroy the antibiotic itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Resist Entry of the Antibiotic</h3>
<p>Many antibiotcs have to gain entry to the interior of the cell to be effective. If a bacterial cell has a mutation that changes the cell surface receptors then the antibiotic can no longer enter the cell. In some cases even slowing down the rate at which these enter the cell can make the difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Remove Antibiotic from the cell</h3>
<p>Some mutations allow for membrane proteins to actively expel any antibiotics that do manage to make it inside the cell. Some of these are so efficient that even high doses of the drug can be removed, rendering it ineffective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Change Antibiotic Binding Sites</h3>
<p>Since many antibiotics bind to prokaryote structures and interfere with their function, any changes that prevent such binding negates the effect of the antibiotic. The antibiotics that interfere with protein synthesis bind to different parts of the bacterial ribosome. Any changes to that structure leaves the antibiotic unable to bind and cause its effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Alter Metabolic Pathways</h3>
<p>Sulfonamides disrupt the folic acid synthesis pathway. Some bacteria have enzymes that allow for an alternate way to manufacture necessary intermediates and bypass the normal pathway. Even if the drug shuts down the main pathway, another is available to provide the necessary nutrients.&nbsp;</p>

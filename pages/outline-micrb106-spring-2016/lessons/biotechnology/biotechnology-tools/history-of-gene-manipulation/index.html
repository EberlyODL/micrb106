<p style="text-align: left; ">Discussions about the genetic manipulation of living organisms often bring up a certain level of discomfort for many who do not necessarily understand the process fully. Ask someone what they thing about genetic engineering or gene therapy and they may not fully understand it, but they will imagine something sinister out of a book or movie. Society has been exposed to fantastical visions of creatures like Frankenstein or mutant, killer animals created in a lab. There is a visceral reaction among people that it&#39;s unnatural to play with life in this way. Some accuse science of trying to play god. This sometimes common view, while not accurate, permeates the thinking of a good many people. The reality tends to be much less exotic. After all, genetic manipulation has been occurring for centuries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Humans have been interested in creating new varieties of plants and animals for thousands of years. Almost all domesticated animals in their current form today exist due to a centuries long breeding program. The same can be said about the grains, fruits, and vegetables we eat every day. Agriculture of the past several millennia would not have developed without the use of specialized varieties of domesticated (genetically manipulated) plants. One could argue that modern civilization would not exist unless our ancestors had developed effective farming techniques including those that rely on selective breeding programs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Exactly what was happening was not understood by people even a hundred years ago. Everyone knew that children looked a bit like their parents and animals with desired traits could be produced if parents of certain traits would have offspring. Selective breeding programs were considered something of a science even though the methods were crude and the results did not always turn out as expected.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; ">Today scientists have a much better understanding of genetics thanks to pioneers like Gregor Mendel for his work on plants and the team of Watson and Crick for their description of DNA itself. We have come a long way and have an excellent understanding of what genes are and how to analyze and manipulate them. Scientists have developed tools and technologies that were unimaginable even 30 or 40 years ago. This image shows some of the developments that will be explored.</p>

<p>If one looked at the sequence of two humans you would see that more than 99% of the base sequence would be identical. However, that remaining portion that is different would be virtually unique to that individual. While it is not possible with current technology to figure out the complete sequence of a person&rsquo;s DNA it is possible to look for patterns in the DNA to compare two people.</p>
<p>In DNA fingerprinting restriction enzymes are used to cut DNA into a collection of different sized pieces. Since two people will have slight variations in their DNA sequence, a restriction enzyme would have cut sites in different places and the DNA would be cut into different sized pieces. If the DNA of two individuals is cut with the same set of enzymes we would generate two piles of DNA in different sizes. Those two sets of DNA fragments can be separated according to size using Electrophoresis. In the end, you would expect to see two different banding patterns on the gel. Each pattern would be a nearly unique &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; made up of a specific set of DNA fragments.</p>

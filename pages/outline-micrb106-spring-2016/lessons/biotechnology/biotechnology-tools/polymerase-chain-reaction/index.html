<p>One bit of technology that has increased the speed by which scientists can analyze DNA sequences is the Polymerase Chain Reaction. It&rsquo;s often the case that even when some bit of DNA is found there may only be a small quantity available for study. Often fairly large amounts of DNA are needed for proper analysis. This is true in cases where a small sample of DNA is found at a crime scene or a small bit of tissue is available. A few cells at the end of a hair follicle or a drop of blood provide enough DNA for PCR to amplify and allow analysis. The sample is loaded into a machine containing a special polymerase and all the necessary nucleotides. When it is done there will be thousands of exact copies of the initial sample of DNA. The following shows how the Polymerase Chain Reaction works.</p>

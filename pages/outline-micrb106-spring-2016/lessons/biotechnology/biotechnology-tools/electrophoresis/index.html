<h2>Electrophoresis and Sequencing of DNA</h2>
<p align="left">If enough DNA is available for analysis, it is possible to figure out the exact sequence of the letters found in the DNA strand itself. A gene is just a set of nucleotides in a very specific sequence. But what are the exact letters that make up a gene? A gene may be a few hundred or even a few thousand nucleotides long. It&rsquo;s entirely possible to sequence a segment of DNA and figure out what the exact sequence of A&rsquo;s and T&rsquo;s and C&rsquo;s and G&rsquo;s really looks like.</p>

<h2>Human Genome Project</h2>
<p>In the late 80&rsquo;s the scientific community had developed enough technology to allow for the sequencing of long pieces of DNA. They undertook a project that was thought at the time would consume years and years if not decades of effort to sequence all the several billion letters of the human genome. It turns out that the project took less than a decade due to technological advances in robotics that made what is a very tedious job go much faster. Today we have a general map of the 20,000 or more genes found in humans. What all these genes do is unknown for the most part. Intensive research is ongoing to this day attempting to make sense of all the data generated as part of this project. Some practical applications include the development of a variety of genetic tests that show how some people are predisposed to certain genetic diseases.</p>

<h2>Frankenfoods . . . coming to a store near you!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Do a search on the web using the term Frankenfoods. How many hits do you get? Genetically modified foods were among the first organisms to be modified for profit. Since everyone needs to eat every day there is a dual interest in genetically modified foods. First, famine and hunger is an ever present condition in many places around the world. Wars and civil unrest in all sorts of countries can be traced to the basic necessity of finding food to feed a family. Agriculture is still practiced in ways unchanged over thousands of years, in many corners of the planet. Obviously it would be more productive to help people grow their own food rather than ship grain thousands of miles from one country with a surplus to a place where people are starving.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s then equally true that if several billion people need to eat every day there exists a captive consumer pool for anyone willing to sell food to people. The profit motive is as huge as the number of people who need to be fed on a daily basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Biotech companies have worked for many years to produce genetically modified crops that are easier to grow, will grow in harsh environments, or contain more nutrient value. This helps farmers produce more food for more people and everyone gets to make a buck or two in the process. However, there is a strong movement in certain countries that resists this type of genetically modified food crop. These foods are derisively called a Frankenfood to stir up images of a mindless destructive killing organism out to destroy humans. Think of a tomato with a fish growing out it and you&#39;ll be on the path to understanding the intensity of the controversy.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually this is not far from the truth. A gene from a fish acclimated to cold waters has been inserted into a tomato plant. The resulting GMO is able to resist frost and can potentially be grown in northern climates even in the winter time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a great deal of zeal behind those opposed to this kind of genetic modification of food. Mostly based on misunderstanding (or, worse, intentionally misleading) science that many web sites spread about partially accurate information designed to scare people into opposing such crops.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Of course others use the same imagery to point out the things that can happen if such progress is halted through unjustified criticism.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are risks associated with genetically modified organisms. These are the same risks that the public faces any time a new drug is prescribed at the doctor&#39;s office. New risks involve changes to the environment if GMO&#39;s were released into wild populations of plants. These are risks that need careful study and evaluation. Weigh the benefits and risks to producing GMO&#39;s. Try to carefully weigh any real risks (as opposed to imagined ones) with the possible benefits to humans.</p>

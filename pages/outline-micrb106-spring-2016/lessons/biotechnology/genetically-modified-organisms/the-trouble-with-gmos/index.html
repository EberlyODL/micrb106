<p>Is the manipulation of genes in living organisms new? NO! (not really) If you think about it, humans have been manipulating genes since the dawn of history actually. The process of selective breeding involves allowing pairs of desirable animals, for example to breed offspring that will hopefully have characterists of both of the parents combined. Look at all the breeds of dogs and cats and farm animals seen today. Many of these did not exist even a few hundred years ago. The corn on the cob we enjoy today is derived from indian maize that was quite different when Europeans landed in North America. Many of the items seen in a grocery store were varities created by selective breeding, we&#39;re quite good at that process.</p>

<p>Genetically modified organisms are of legitimate concern for a number of reasons. There is a sensitivity about the safety of genetically modified plants, particularly in Europe. The mad cow disease outbreak some years ago has made them particularly sensitive about the food production industry. However, much of what you can read online is simply misplaced fear, plants have been modified but they are not necessarily any more harmful than a new strain of turnip that resulted from selective breeding practices. There has been tremendous amounts of research to ensure safety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are however a few areas of concern. The biggest one is allergic reactions. People can be allergic to the most mundane things, fatally allergic in some cases. The fear is that if genes are exchanged and someone has an odd allergy problem, it may crop up in foods that are not normally considered a problem. Another issue is the transfer of genes from one plant species to another. There are concerns that such a transfer could have unintended consequences that may result in a loss of biodiversity. These are a couple of issues worthy of discussion and study.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what are the differences between making a genetically modified organism instead of using traditional selective breeding practices. For one, selective breeding is not at all certain to provide success. The whole point of sexual reproduction is to allow for the creation of different outcomes each time. You look and act very different from your siblings yet everyone comes from the same two parents. Selective breeding produces thousands of new phenotype combination. It can take a lot of time and a large dose of luck to stumble upon just the right combination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand genetic engineering is very, very precise. Rather than mixing up a hundreds of genes and finding the one combination out of thousands of attempts, only one gene, one phenotype, is transferred. Everything else remains exactly the same, but one new desirable trait is conferred. The genes involved are very well understood and their function is well known. Overall, genetic engineering is LESS likely to lead to unknown gene effects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vibrio are gram negative rods that inhabit the intestinal tract of humans, who are the only natural host of the organism. The main pathogen in this family is Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. This infections starts with the ingestion of contaminated food, or especially drink. Contaminated water supplies are the usual culprit. Cholera is an age old killing disease that crops up anywhere humans have lived close together, using a single source of water, the local river or lake.</p>
<p>Vibrio organisms are usually killed by stomach acid. Still a large enough dose in badly contaminated water will result in a few survivors making it into the small intestine. Here they secrete a toxin that interferes with water absorption in the digestive tract. Rather than absorbing water from the intestines into the bloodstream, the toxin causes a hypersecretion of Cl- ions INTO the small intestine. This is the exact reverse of what normally happens during water absorption. This leads to a net loss of water INTO the intestines resulting in large amounts of watery diarrhea.</p>
<p>Patients can lose 10 and up to 20 liters of fluid per day. Each milliliter may contain 1,000,000,000 microbes. This causes a significant problem for local authorities regarding effective disposal of so much heavily contaminated fluid. All it takes is a few sick individuals producing gallons of contaminated fluids to end up being dumped into the local water supply to make thousands sick in a very short amount of time.</p>
<p>After an incubation period of a couple of days, patients have vomiting and diarrhea. Loss of fluids at these rates quickly leads to severe dehydration, metabolic acidosis, cardiovascular shock and death. Interestingly the infection itself causes no damage to the intestines, all the trouble comes from severe fluid loss. Depending on the severity of the case it's often not possible to drink enough to keep up, many times intravenous fluid replacement is necessary to save the patient. So long as fluids are efficiently replaced the disease will run its course without lasting effects.</p>
<p>Cholera is heavily endemic to countries in Africa and Asia without clean drinking water or where sanitation is a problem. Outbreaks of cholera like diseases do happen in developed countries in places where water supplies or foodstuffs become contaminated. The Gulf Coast of the US sometimes sees this type of outbreak due to improperly cooked shellfish. So long as access to safe drinking water is available, cholera outbreaks are rare. There are vaccines available but they are not long lasting. Vaccination gives protection for 6 months to a year, after 2 years the effectiveness falls to 50%, not ideal for herd immunity. Therefore prevention is the most effective method of keeping everyone healthy.</p>

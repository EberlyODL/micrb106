<p><em><strong>Bordatella pertussis</strong></em> is an organism that infects the upper respiratory tract of humans and animals. Whooping cough is a progressive respiratory condition that tends to be an issue in small children though anyone can get the disease. The microbe is entirely limited to the human respiratory tract and prefers to live amongst the cilia of the trachea and bronchial passageways. The infection is completely noninvasive, it causes no cellular damage, it merely inhibits normal cell funtions.</p>
<p>In children, a 10 day incubation period is followed by the onset of cold symptoms and a mild cough. At this stage many organisms are carried in the aerosols produced by coughing and sneezing. The patient is not particularly ill but is HIGHLY contagious. A week or two after the cold symptoms the infection moves into the lower respiratory tract deeper in the lungs. Here the bacteria cause a phenomenon called <strong>ciliostasis</strong>, or freezing of the movement of the cilia. These cilia in the lungs help remove and clear out mucous in the lungs. In addition, toxins are produced that causes inflammation.</p>
<p>The infection causes a narrowing of the air passageways which leads to bouts of extreme coughing. These fits can become so bad the child vomits or goes into convulsions. The coughing takes on a unique pattern called whooping as the child tries to breathe in through contricted bronchioles. The video below will let you hear what this sounds like.</p>

<p>This is one of those childhood diseases that was no the verge of extinction until the anti-vaccine movement began. A very effective vaccine has been in use for decades but as parents refuse to have their children vaccinated in recent years, there has been a resurgence of this childhood disease.</p>

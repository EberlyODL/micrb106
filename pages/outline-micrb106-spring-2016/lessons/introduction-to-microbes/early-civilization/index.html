<p>Looking back in the past to the time before people were able to record history, it&#39;s instructive to think about how early humans must have lived. These were tribal based groups living in small communities without much interaction with anyone except the tribe over the hill or across the river. At this time populations were small due to a variety of factors including accidental deaths and run ins with dangerous wildlife. Lifespans&nbsp;were short due to death from endemic infections in general, during birth in particular. Infant mortality rates were high and only a few individuals survived to adulthood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, groups banded together into larger communities as the invention of agriculture gave rise to civilizations as we think of them today. By domesticating animals and plants, food supplies increased leading to a higher standard of living. Food preservation technology (ie, converting grains to alcohol for long term storage) led to increases in population even though the cities were now dependant on outside sources for food. This led to trade with other towns and cities and people started to travel from place to place in search of things they could use back home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the consequences of having lots of people living together and having those people travel to other places is an increase in the spread of disease. If an epidemic hits a small village that no one really leaves, that population may die off but that would be the end of the outbreak. Once diseases start to spread in a big city, traders can then deliver them to other cities where it becomes quickly spread around through the population. Many inevitably become sick. Eventually resistance to these epidemic illnesses increase but only after many people die off during the outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human beings have developed a pattern of civilization that tends to reoccur though the ages even till today. Perhaps you have heard of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It goes like this, War begins when one group of people want something another group of people have. During wars, local farmers are driven off their land or killed outright. This leads to the next stage, Famine, as there are few people left to feed everyone. Starvation tends to weaken a population, making them susceptible to the next stage, Pestilence. Widespread disease leads to the final stage, Death of large segments of the population not directly tied to a battlefield somewhere.&nbsp;</p>

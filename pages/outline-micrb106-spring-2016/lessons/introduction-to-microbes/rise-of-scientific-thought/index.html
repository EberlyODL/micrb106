<p>As we have seen, the ancient Egyptians, Greeks and later Romans all made contributions to science in their day, but many of their beliefs were still rooted in the supernatural world. All of those cultures had religious tradition of praying to many gods each of who were supposed to deal with a specific human concern. There were gods for healing, fertility, the harvest and success in war. Naturally many of their understandings of the natural world were attributed to the actions of one or more of the gods. For example, the sun traversed the sky each day on Apollo&#39;s chariot.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">More modern scientific views were first developed during the Renaissance period of European history. During this time it became possible to begin to build sophisticated tools that allowed for the study of objects poorly understood at the time. Technology had advanced enough to create devices like telescopes and even microscopes to look at things either very far away or very small. Without being able to see object clearly, it is no wonder that the ancient Romans and Greeks relied on supernatural explanations for natural events.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">So a certain level of technology&nbsp;was developed and new philosophies about the natural world came to light during the Renaissance. People were asking questions about nature rather than merely accepting the views that had existed up to that time. As a result, a long string of visionaries came along and each contributed something to the development of modern science. It is important to understand the contributions of these men before we discuss the development of Microbiology. First it is necessary to understand how the discipline of science evolved from the period known as the Dark Ages.</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">One of the earliest advocates of using the experimental method, Roger Bacon was a Franciscan friar who taught about Aristotle at Oxford College in England. He was very interested in the budding scientific disciplines of physics and alchemy. He wrote about optics and predicted the future development of telescopes, microscopes and spectacles. He&#39;s best known for advocating the study of science topics in colleges which at that time were almost entirely devoted to philosophy and theology. Because he was friends with the pope, his ideas were taken seriously even though nothing much was done about it at the time.</p>

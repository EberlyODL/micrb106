<p>When most people think about bacteria and viruses, there is an almost unconscious feeling that these are only harmful to humans. Indeed many of the reasons we study microbes relate to medicine and the need to find effective ways to keep them from causing us harm. <strong>Pathogens</strong> are disease causing microorganisms and much of what we study in a course like this relates to the dangerous bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>There are 2000 disease causing organisms that we know of. These cause 10 billion infections worldwide per year resulting in untold numbers of deaths. Today we recognize that many medical conditions have a root cause associated with an unnoticed microbial infection. Such chronic infections can lead to conditions we don&#39;t associate with infections like ulcers, MS, heart conditions and even cancer. Much of what we do in medicine is try to come to grips with all these infections and either try to kill the microbes at fault or at least try to deal with the diseases they cause. We even try to prevent them from becoming a problem in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, microbes are not all bad. Humans have been able to use microbes in a variety of very important ways which have advanced our civilization. Humans use microbes to produce a whole host of important foods. This was especially important in times before we could preserve food with refridgeration and modern food packaging. Using microbes to make cheese and yogurt for example is a way of preserving milk which would otherwise quickly spoil. Some have argued that before beer production, there was no need to build cities. You could say that alcohol production is the very foundation of our entire civilization!&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days we use microbes on an industrial scale to not only preserve a wide variety of foods but we also use them to produce medicines like antibiotics. <strong>Biotechnology</strong> is an industry that uses microbes to produce many products from food to chemicals to medicines. Modern science even allows us to manipulate living organisms at the genetic level via Genetic Engineering using recombinant DNA technology. We will explore many of these uses in future lessons.&nbsp;</p>

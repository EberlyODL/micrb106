<p>In 1854 Pasteur was appointed Dean and professor of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences in Lille, France. Lille was an industrial town with a number of distilleries and factories. The Minister of Public Instruction was not completely sold on "science for science&#39;s sake". He reminded university faculty that "whilst keeping up with scientific theory, you should, in order to produce useful and far reaching results, appropriate to yourselves the special applications suitable to the real wants of the surrounding country."</p>
<p>Pasteur, in contrast to other faculty, needed no prodding. He enjoyed taking his students on tours of the factories and was quick to advise the managers that he was available to help solve their problems. In the summer of 1856, M. Bigot, father of one of his students in chemistry, called upon Pasteur to help him overcome difficulties he was having manufacturing alcohol by fermentation of beetroot. Often, instead of alcohol, Bigot&#39;s fermentations yielded lactic acid.</p>
<p>To better appreciate the discoveries to follow, we should understand what was believed at that time about alcoholic fermentation. Chemistry was emerging as a true science, freed from the pseudoscience of the alchemist (the guys trying to turn lead into gold). The mysterious chemical processes of living animals were slowly being unraveled in strictly chemical terms. Fermentation leading to production of wine, beer and vinegar was believed to be a straightforward chemical breakdown of sugar to the desired molecules. The chemical experts of the day proclaimed that the breakdown of sugar into alcohol during fermentation of sugar to wine and beer was due to the presence of "inherent unstabilizing vibrations<b>"</b>. (You know, magic.) One could transfer these unstabilizing vibrations from a vat of finished wine to new grape pressings to start fermentation anew.</p>
<p>Yeast cells were found in the fermenting vats of wine, but they were believed simply to be a <em>product</em> not the cause of it. Apparently there was some spontaneous generation proponents still hanging around. Some biologists thought the yeast was the agent <em>causing</em> the fermentation but they were ridiculed by the scientific experts. The chemists thought they were clever enough to have figured out how the chemistry worked and were not about to let a microscopic living organism get all the credit!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the "scientific establishment" was not providing much help to the brewers of wine, beer and vinegar. These manufacturers were plagued by serious economic problems related to their fermentations. Yields of alcohol might suddenly fall off; wine might unexpectedly grow ropy or sour or turn to vinegar; vinegar, when desired, might not be formed and lactic acid might appear in its place; the quality and taste of beer might unexpectedly change making quality control a nightmare. All too often the producers would be forced to throw out the resultant batches, start anew, and sadly have no better luck!</p>
<p>Into M. Bigot&#39;s factory, microscope in hand, came Pasteur. He quickly found three clues that allowed him to solve the puzzle of alcoholic fermentation.</p>
<ul>
	<li>First, when alcohol was produced normally, the yeast cells were plump and budding. But when lactic acid would form rather than alcohol, small rod like microbes were always mixed with the yeast cells. Something else was present when things went bad.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Second, analysis of the batches of alcohol showed that odd alcohols and other complex organic compounds were being formed during the fermentation. This could not be explained by the simple catalytic breakdown of sugar. Something else was going on.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Third, and this may have been the critical clue to Pasteur, some of these chemical compounds &#39;rotated&#39; light, a unique physical trait. Pasteur suspected that only living cells produced such compounds. He concluded and was able to prove that living cells, the yeast, were responsible for forming alcohol from sugar, and that contaminating microorganisms turned the fermentations sour!</li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next several years Pasteur identified and isolated the specific microorganisms responsible for normal and abnormal fermentations in production of wine, beer, vinegar. He showed that if one heated wine, beer, milk to moderately high temperatures for a few minutes, he could kill living microorganisms and thereby sterilize (<strong>pasteurize</strong>), the batches and prevent their degradation. If pure cultures of microbes and yeasts were added to sterile mashes uniform, predictable fermentations would follow.</p>

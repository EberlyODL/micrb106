<p>The Lysogenic cycle can be seen in all types of viruses but this cycle was first noticed as a feature in bacterial viruses or <strong>bacteriophage</strong> (phage for short). Like all viruses phage are very specific for which bacterial cells they infect. In medicine they are used to <strong>phage type</strong> the many sub-strains of any given bacterial species to further identify it for epidemiological purposes. It&#39;s possible to infect a particular bacterial sample (an organism responsible for an outbreak of food poisoning for example) and by knowing which phage strain was used, eventually identify the strain of bacteria at hand. Bacteriophage are used in some countries as a method of killing off a bacterial infection in patients rather than using antibiotics. Since these are bacterial viruses they should not harm our cells, only the pathogens causing an infection. This treatment is not used much in Western medicine given the easy access to powerful antibiotics but they are used around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These bacterial viruses follow all the same steps as the lytic cycle: Adsoprtion/Attachment, Penetration, Synthesis, Assembly and Release. However, in some cases (and this is seen in animal cell retroviruses) once the viral genome gains access to the host cell and before it takes over the cell machinery to begin replication, the viral genes fuse with the bacterial cell&#39;s chromosome and go dormant.</p>

<p>This then is the Lysogenic cycle, not all viruses do this. At this point we now call the bacteriophage a <strong>prohpage</strong> (basically the same thing as the provirus mentioned earlier) which does nothing until some sort of inducing event causes it to excise from the chromosome and go back into the lytic cycle. Sometimes the viral genome accidentally grabs genes from the bacterial chromosome at the insertion site where it was hiding. Now the viral genome may contain bacterial genes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a couple problems caused by the ability of viruses to enter this Lysogenic or dormant state. First as just noted they carry viral genes that could include genes from other cells that the virus would not otherwise have. In the case of phage, they may pick up disease causing genes from the previous host bacterial cell and carry them into the new host cell. In this way a bacterial cell could acquire genetic traits (often pathogenic traits) that it would not otherwise have. Sometimes otherwise harmless bacteria turn into dangerous pathogens in this way.</p>
<p>Second the process of the virus DNA inserting and removing itself from the host cell chromosome may disrupt the genes of the host cell. This actually leads to a variety of cancers in humans for example. The insertion of viral DNA into the cell leads to <strong>Transformation</strong> of the cell into a cancer cell which is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. These <strong>oncoviruses</strong> may contain <strong>oncogenes</strong> that disrupt host cell cycle regulation leading to runaway cell growth. Sometimes the virus inserts itself into the middle of a host cell gene that controls cell division thereby destroying its function. Again, we get uncontrolled cell growth. There are many ways in which viruses can cause cancer, more than can be easily discussed here.&nbsp;</p>

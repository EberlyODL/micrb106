<p>We grow viruses in the lab for the general study of virus structure and function, to identify specific strains for epidemiological purposes (tracking flu epidemics for example) and to use the viruses to prepare vaccines, one of the most effective means we have to combat them.&nbsp;To grow viruses one must be able to grow appropriate host cells. For bacteriophage this is very easy. Microbiologists have been growing pure cultures of bacteria for well over 100 years. A small amount of phage applied to a petri dish covered in bacteria provides a welcome place for the phage to replicate and multiply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can cultivate plant and animal viruses in a similar fashion by growing flasks of plant and animal cells in culture. One the appropriate cells are grown, liver cells for example, viruses can be introduced to replicate in the host cells. At one time this was a difficult endeavor, but the technology has advanced to the point where we teach undergraduates how to do this in science labs at most universities. Some students even do this in high school these days. (well, grow animal cells, not play with HIV....)</p>
<p>Animal viruses can also be easily grown in miniature, all natural growth vessels: eggs. An egg has a sterile interior full of cells and all the nutrients those cells could need to grow and thrive. If a tiny hole is carefully made in the egg and virus is injected, it will infect and multiply quite nicely inside the egg. While growing host cells in culture is possible, it&#39;s expensive, time consuming and the volumes available are limited. With eggs, one can keep adding as many eggs as needed to get the volume of virus production necessary. Eggs are a relatively cheap way to go compared to other methods. Most of the flu vaccine made each year is produced from eggs, though much research is being done to get away from egg based vaccine production. Any one allergic to eggs has problems with this type of vaccine.&nbsp;</p>

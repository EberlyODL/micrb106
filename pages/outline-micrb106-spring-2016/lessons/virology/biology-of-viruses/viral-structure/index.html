<p>The first thing to note about viruses is that they are really, really small. In the early days of microbiology no one could even see a virus, they are too tiny for a light microscope to work. People would pass fluids through filters and catch all the bacteria, yet the fluid remained infectious if given to an animal. This gave rise to the idea of filterable viruses. Viruses are 10x and up to 1000x smaller than bacteria.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure of viruses seems to be pretty simple. They are basically a bit of nucleic acid surrounded by a protective protein shell called the <strong>Capsid</strong>. This capsid is made up of proteins called<strong> Capsomers</strong> that form a very definite shape when assembled together. A viral particle of this type, the capsid and nucleic acid material it surrounds, is referred to as a <strong>nucleocapsid</strong> or an intact virus particle. Viruses can be helical in shape or icosahedral (like multi sided dice used in some games). Some capsids are even more complex and look a bit like something you&#39;d use to land on the moon. Often times there will be a few viral proteins packaged inside the virus that helps it hijack and take over a host cell to allow the virus to make new copies of itself. More on that later.</p>
<p>Sometimes this capsid shell is itself surrounded by a phospholipid layer not unlike a regular cell membrane. This viral <strong>Envelope</strong> helps to protect the virus and also to help it gain entry to, and eventual infection of, a host cell. Many times this envelope will contain protein spikes that aid in the attachment of a virus to its host cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since all of these outer structures of the virus particle are made out of protein, they have a definite 3D shape. This shape is recognized and targeted by the Immune System. When the genes that code for these proteins mutate and change the protein shape even a little, they disrupt the ability of the immune system to recognize and target it. This gives rise to all of the different strains of viruses which has huge implications in medicine. It also explains why you always seem to get a cold every winter. Once you&#39;re exposed to a certain cold virus you should be immune to it after that. You keep getting colds because you keep becoming exposed to more and more and more different strains. By the time you enter retirement you could have been exposed to hundreds of strains, but you&#39;ll still keep getting sick from time to time. This also explains why you have to get a flu shot every year as new strains emerge every year.&nbsp;</p>

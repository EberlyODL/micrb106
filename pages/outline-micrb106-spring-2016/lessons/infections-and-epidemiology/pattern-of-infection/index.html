<p>Every infection follows a certain pattern gaining access to the body and causing of symptoms and potential damage, even death. Not all organisms are capable of causing disease so easily. Remember we live with billions of normal flora every day without consequence. The bacteria that are capable of causing disease are the <strong>Pathogens</strong>. The true pathogens are the really mean ones we hear about in the news and from family and friends who get sick. There are other potential harmful bacteria, the <strong>Opportunistic Pathogens</strong> who are capable of causing disease but require some sort of predisposing condition or weakness of our immune system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interaction between host and parasite is a complex one. One person gets sick but another does not. All pathogens are not equal in their abilities to cause disease. Some are more virulent than others. <strong>Virulence</strong> is a measure of how "mean" the organism is. The most serious disease causing bacteria may form a capsule or produce highly damaging toxins. There are lots of different examples of virulence factors that contribute to how harmful a particular organism can be.</p>
<p>Many factors come into play before you get sick.&nbsp;How virulent the organism is only makes up a part of the story. How much you are exposed to makes a difference. Does the pathogen gain access to the proper portal of entry? Have you been exposed to that specific strain before? Do you have a level of immunity? Finally, how healthy is the individual in general? The elderly succumb to influenza by the tens of thousands every year but it is rarely fatal to someone in their 20's. Diabetics or someone undergoing chemotherapy are far more susceptible to infections as are those who have HIV.</p>
<p>The onset of an infection follows a certain pattern in most cases. This sequence of events from encounter with the pathogen till it leaves your system is shown below.&nbsp;</p>

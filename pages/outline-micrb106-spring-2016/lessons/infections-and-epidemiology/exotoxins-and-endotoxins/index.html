<p>Bacteria produce a number of toxins that are categorized into two categories: exotoxins and endotoxins.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Exotoxins</h3>
<p>These bacterial toxins are primarily produced by gram positive bacteria and are made up of protein. Because of this they have a highly specific 3D shape that can be attacked by heat or protein digesting enzymes. Being somewhat unstable, temperatures over 60&deg; C will denature them and render them harmless. Also, stomach acid tends to destroy exotoxin but a high enough dose will still have an effect.</p>
<p>Being a protein they are highly antigenic and strongly stimulate the immune response which makes them good candidates for toxoid vaccines; Tetanus shots for example. Exotoxins target a particular receptor site on our cells which they bind to and won&#39;t bind to anything else. This means they very specifically target certain cells. They are also highly toxic, even in minute amounts. One ounce of diptheria toxin would be enough to kill everyone in a large city like New York or London.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Enterotoxins</strong> are a subset of exotoxins that specifically target the intestinal tract causing vomiting, diarrhea and cramping or abdominal pain. The interfere with the way cells of the intestinal lining process solutes which leave too much fluid in the intestinal tract. Clostridium, Cholera, Dysentary and Staphylococcal food poising are all examples of enterotoxins at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Endotoxins</h3>
<p>These toxins are actually an integral part of the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria. Called Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) it differs greatly from the exotoxins. Endotoxin is quite stable, even when heated. Since it is part lipid and sugar it does not have the strong 3D structure that a protein would, therefore it does not make for a good toxoid vaccine.</p>
<p>The mechanism of action is more widespread and is active in several ways. The lipid portion inserts into cell membranes of white blood cells and vascular endothelial tissue leading to a variety of effects on the body. It is <strong>Pyrogenic</strong>, or it causes a fever in low doses. It also causes low blood pressure and a loss of neutrophils.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this toxin is part of the membrane structure of the gram negative cells, attacks by the immune system actually releases it into the bloodstream. For this reason, if someone has a massive gram negative infection (bacteremia) the situation becomes very serious. When the immune system sets out to destroy the bacteria it releases massive amounts of endotoxin into the bloodstream. In large doses, endotoxin causes irreversible <strong>Hypotension</strong> (blood pressure plummets) leading to fatal systemic shock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shock is a term used to describe a loss of fluids in the cardiovascular system. This can come from many causes including dehydration, vomiting, diarrhea and blood loss. In this case,<strong> Infectious Shock</strong>, the blood vessels open up wide and fluids leave the blood stream. Note however that no fluids are lost from the body. Normally for shock you give someone a transfusion or IV saline solution to bring blood volume up. That won&#39;t work here, in fact it makes matters worse. The problem is the blood vessels are too dilated to hold any fluid. Adding more fluids by IV only leads to more fluid loss as the patient gets more and more puffy and swollen. Treatment includes vasoactive drugs and digitalis to get the heart beating harder. It&#39;s a very serious condition.</p>
<p>Another condition caused by endotoxin is&nbsp;<strong>disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)</strong>. In this disease blood clotting mechanisms are induced when they are not needed. Tiny blood clots for all throughout the cardiovascular system. This leads to a loss of the ability to clot the blood when it is needed. As a result the patient bleeds easily, almost like someone with hemophilia.&nbsp;</p>

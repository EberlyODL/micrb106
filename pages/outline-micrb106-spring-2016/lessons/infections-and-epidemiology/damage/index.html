<p><strong>Causing Disease:</strong></p>
<p>The symptoms of the disease state are caused primarily by the damage that pathogens do once they become established and reproduce to sufficient numbers. Until this time, the person may have no idea that anything is going on. By the onset of symptoms, the damage being done is already underway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The damage caused by a particular pathogen varies and some cause damage in multiple ways. Pathogens secrete a variety of extracellular enzymes that may cause cell death (as in the case of gangrene) or merely inflammation (as with a rash). Some examples include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Hyaluronidase - degrades a main component of connective tissue</li>
	<li>Collagenase - degrades collagen also found in connective tissue</li>
	<li>Coagulase - causes clotting of blood plasma fibrin, used to stop bleeding, thus depleting it</li>
	<li>Fibrinolysin - degrades fibrin</li>
	<li>Hemolysin - destroys red blood cells</li>
</ul>
<p>Pathogens may secrete exotoxins and endotoxins which have wide ranging effects. Many of these effects alter body physiology as in tetanus, botulism and cholera. We&#39;ll talk more about these toxins next.</p>
<p>Some pathogens may induce an inappropriate or outright excessive immune response. Some autoimmune diseases are caused by an underlying or even previous infection. The different types of damage are summarized below:</p>

<p>There are also forms of damage that are mechanical in nature. Parasites can get into various tubing systems of the body like blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and things like bile ducts, leading to blockages. The image below shows what happens when lymphatic vessels become blocked. These normally drain fluid from tissues (like when you smash your thumb and it swells up) and return it to the cardiovascular system. When blocked they lead to swelling of the extremities. This particular image shows a condition is called elephantisis of the legs.</p>

<p>The infection process begins when you first encounter the pathogen. The science of Epidemiology is the study of how diseases are transmitted in a population. The basic idea is to track where people were exposed to things. We interact with objects and people that carry organisms on a daily basis; at home with family and friends, at school, at the ball field, in the mall, on an airplane or bus, in the public restroom, the hall way in the dorm, that lecure hall with 300 students, handing over a dollar for a cup of coffee. There are hundreds of things you touch and people you are around every day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just being exposed to pathogens every day does not mean you&#39;ll get sick every day. The pathogen must gain entry to your body through what a called <strong>Portals of Entry</strong>. Different pathogens need to use the right portal for them to cause infection. A respiratory virus on your elbow is utterly harmless. Get it on your hands and touch your face, then you may have a problem. Various portals and common pathogens are listed below. Click the image to make it larger.</p>

<p>Microbial infections are contracted in one of two methods, exogenously or endogenously. An exogenous source of infection is also known as a<strong> Communicable Disease</strong>, one you get from others and can pass on to others once you become sick. This type of transmission can be from direct personal contact with someone (or insects for example) or it may come indirectly via food or drink or droplets in the air. One common indirect pathway is interaction with a <strong>Fomite</strong>, an inantimate object like a door handle or even coins and dollar bills. (they don&#39;t call it dirty money for nothing)&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other main method of encounter is via a <strong>Non-Communicable</strong> route. Strange as it sounds, you can make yourself sick. If bacteria like normal flora or an opprtunistic pathogen you harbor makes its way from one location to another you can have an enounter event and entry via a different portal of entry. There are also environmental exposure events from water or soil organisms. Stepping on a rusty nail can lead to tetanus infection. That&#39;s not something you catch from someone else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One other important aspect of the infection process at this point is the amount of organism you&#39;re exposed to. Some organisms are dangerous even in low numbers but for others it take a huge exposure to actually initiate an infection. This is called the <strong>Infectious Dose.</strong> We will see later that this critical mass of cells required will vary from one pathogen to anther.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Measures of Morbidity and Mortality: Rates</h3>
<p>Once you have the information in hand, it&#39;s time to try and figure out what&#39;s going on with the given disease under study. Measures of morbidity and mortality are presented as <strong>rates</strong> to define the distribution and extent of the disease. Statistics are give as 1/2000 people will get this or that disease. The numbers here require some explanation</p>
<p>The number on top, the numeratory represents the number of people in a given population to which something has happened, they have the disease or condition. The bottom number, the denominator is the population at risk. This is all the people in the population that the something noted in the numerator, could have had happen to them. Rates are usually expressed using a denominator base of 1000 or 10,000. This makes it easier to make comparisons like 10/1000 versus 16/1000. Otherwise you&#39;d have to work with 50 cases out of 2500 versus 52 cases out of 3250. Which is greater? It takes too long to work out the math so uniform denominators are used. Of course these rates are only useful if they are compared with what it is known they should be or with what is expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The need to compare is evident when you&#39;re trying to figure out what the risk factors are for two situations. Here is the rate for cancer in people who don&#39;t smoke compared to the rate for those who do. The rates would be higher for smokers than for non smokers. Many things cause cancer, even lung cancer that have nothing to do with smoking yet that is a risk factor which increases your chances of getting lung cancer. If the incidence is normally 5/1000 for a non smoker and the rate is 25/1000 for someone who smokes, you&#39;d say your odds of getting cancer increase 5 fold if you smoke.</p>
<p>These data can be easily misinterpreted. Typically when you read about or hear about some studies, you never see the actual rates. All you see is somone comparing the numerators. You hear that you&#39;re 5 times more likely to get diabetes if you drink 32oz soda. Sometimes politics enters into the reporting of rates. People use the number to push others into certain behaviors. But consider this case. For some given condition the chances of having it are 1/10,000,000 but if you drink a certain brand of energy drink, the rates go up to 2/10,000,000. You&#39;ve just doubled your risk of that bad thing happening!</p>
<p>However, what are the odds of getting something when it&#39;s one in ten million? Zip, nada. What are the odds of it happening when it&#39;s two in ten million? Still zip, still nada. This is how the lottery is said to be a tax on people who can&#39;t do math. When the jackpot is big (and the numbers we have above are far, far better than the odds of actually winning the lottery), people run out and rather than buy one ticket, but two or three or five. They thing they just tripled their odds of winning. Again, what the odd of one in a it&#39;s-never-going-to-happen versus twice as likely to never-gonna-happen?</p>
<p>If all you have are comparisons of the numerators you may be led astray regarding the claim being made. Another thing you hear is &#39;you&#39;re 50% more likely to die of a heart attack unless you exercise for 1 hour per day". What is 50% mean exactly. If the rate is 4 out of a million with exercise and 6 out of a million without it, that is a 50% increase. But it&#39;s only 2 in a million. Again, not very likely. Now if it&#39;s 4/100 vs 6/100 that&#39;s more meaningful but you&#39;ll never know it based on the figures you get in the news.&nbsp;</p>

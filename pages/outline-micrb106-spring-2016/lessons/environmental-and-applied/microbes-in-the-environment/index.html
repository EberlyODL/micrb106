<p>We have seen that bacteria are ubiquitious and can live in just about any environment on the planet. They do more than just survive, they are an integral part of the ecosystems all around us. In many ways, life on Earth could not exist without the activity of microbes. They maintain the cycle of life by returning plant and animal matter to the soil via decomposition. There are billions of microorganims in a teaspoon of soil. By decomposing plant and animal remains back into the basic building blocks of cells they allow new plants to grow which in turn provide food to animals.</p>
<p>The <strong>Rhizosphere </strong>is the zone of topsoil where plant roots make contact. Here the bacteria and and fungi and protozoa carry out a complex symbiotic interaction where each group provides necessary nutrients to the others. Plants produce sugars and amino acids that bacteria can use and in turn, bacteria release factors that stimulate plant growth. These microorganisms are key players in the cycling of two particularly important chemicals in soil ecosystem. Those are the Carbon and Nitrogen cycles</p>
<p>The <strong>carbon cycle</strong> is perhaps familiar from basic biology classes. This was partially discussed in the unit on Metabolism. Plants use the energy of the sun (photosynthesis) to take CO2 from the air, remove the O2 and release it and take the remaining carbon and connect it to other carbons to form organic molecules like glucose. In this way plants can take basic sugars and create just about any organic compound necessary. (They also need Nitrogen to make certain organic molecules but more on that in a minute.)</p>

<p>Once plants use these organic molecules to grow and prosper, they serve as a food source for animals. A cow comes along and eats the grass that has been growing in a field. From here the story is familiar from the Metabolism unit. The cow uses glycolysis and the Krebs cycle to gain energy and releases some Carbon as CO2. The rest of the carbon goes into making cells as the cow grows. Perhaps a predator will eat the cow for the same resasons the cow ate the grass.</p>
<p>Either way, these animals have locked up carbon in their tissues so when the animal dies, microbes come along to go through the decomposition process and ultimately release all the carbon found in the animal cells via the basic metabolic pathways of glycolysis and the krebs cycle. In the end, all of that carbon once forming organic compounds is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, ready for plants to begin the cycle once again.</p>

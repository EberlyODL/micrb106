<p>Considering that most of the surface of the earth is covered in water, it should not be surprising that bacteria live in just about all corners of this aquatic environment. Not all water is the same however and bacteria have adjusted to live in every known aqueous condition. Bacteria live in freshwater and salt water. In fact some live perfectly happily in VERY salty water, halophiles for example. Temperature is no barrier to where bacteria are found. Very cold waters deep in the ocean are home to bacteria. Very hot water near thermal vents or hot springs provide habitat for thermophilic bacteria. Even the high barometric pressures deep in the ocean are no barrier to where microbes (barophiles) can thrive. For every specific living condition in a body of water, there are microorganisms there that make their home.</p>
<p>Many aquatic microorganisms form the basis of the food chain for all other living organisms present. Microscopic phytoplankton and zooplankton are the primary food for many small fishes which in turn feed larger and larger animals up the food chain. Without these simple organisms, live could not easily exist in the lakes, streams and oceans of the world.</p>
<p>Disruptions to these delicate ecosystems can have significant impacts. When nutrients are suddenly added to the system either through runoff of fertilizers or changes in currents that bring nutrients to the surface, rapid reproduction of certain microorganisms can disrupt the local ecosystem. Under these conditions, called <strong>eutrophication</strong>, blooms can form where cyanobacteria grow so quickly they remove all the oxygen from the water.<strong> Red tide</strong> forms when a sudden growth of red algae dinoflagellates appears. These tiny microorganisms produce a toxin that can be deadly to fish and even humans.</p>

<p>The first step in converting sugar to ATP starts with Glycolysis. This is a multi step series of enzyme conversions of one 6 carbon glucose molecule into a pair of 3 carbon Pyruvate molecules.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to the two Pyruate molecules, this process produces 2 ATP and 2 NADH molecules. The cell will use these two NADH molecules later to either ferment the Pyruvate if no oxygen is present, or the NADH will be saved for aerobic respiration and converted into more ATP.</p>
<p>For our discussion, we&#39;ll assume oxygen is present and move on to the next step, Aerobic Respiration. The pyruvates are next sent on to the Kreb Cycle.&nbsp;</p>

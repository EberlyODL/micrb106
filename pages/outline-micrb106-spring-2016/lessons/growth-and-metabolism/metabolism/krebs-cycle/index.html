<p>The process of Aerobic Respiration is actually a two step process. First the 3 carbon Pyruvates are processed and completely broken down by the <strong>Krebs Cycle</strong>. Each carbon of the Pyruvate is broken off one at a time and combined with oxygen to form CO2. During the process, ATP and other energy compounds are released. The next step will be to take these energy compounds (NADH) and convert them to ATP using the <strong>Electron Transport Chain</strong>.</p>
<p>First let&#39;s look at the Krebs Cycle. This process begins by converting the 3 carbon Pyruvate into a 2 carbon molecule and converting it to <strong>Acetyl CoA</strong>. This newly made Acetyl CoA then feeds into the circular Krebs cycle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two carbon Acetyl CoA is combined with a 4 carbon intermediate (<strong>oxaloacetate</strong>)&nbsp;and the pair of them form a 6 carbon <strong>Citrate</strong> molecule. The rest of the cycle involves a series of metabolic reactions that peel two of those carbons off, combine them with oxygen and form CO2. In the end the original 4 carbon intermediate is reformed and is ready to go through the cycle once again.</p>
<p>A key thing to remember here is that there were TWO Pyruvate molecules produced in the previous step, Glycolysis. That means you have to run the cycle twice.</p>
<p>So aside from all the carbon processing what do we get from all this? Energy products. Each time the cycle goes around it produces <strong>one</strong> <strong>GTP</strong>. This is very similar to ATP so think of it as being equal in how it&#39;s used. (Think the difference between US dollars and Canadian dollars, pretty much worth the same.)</p>
<p>In addition there are <strong>3 NADH</strong> molecules and <strong>1 FADH</strong> molecule produced. Keep in mind that from the original glucose we made two Pyruvates to give us two turns of the cycle so the final tally is actually 2 GTP, 2 FADH and 6 NADH molecules. Not a bad haul for one little glucose. Now the next thing we need to do is proccess all those *DH things.&nbsp;</p>

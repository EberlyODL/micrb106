<p>Temperature has a dramatic effect on the growth of living organisms. At lower temperatures metabolism slows down, eventually becoming too low to sustain life. At higher temperatures, metabolism will increase at first, but eventually the enzymes required for basic cellular chemistry will unfold or <strong>Denature</strong> and be destroyed.</p>
<p>Organisms have a minimal temperature they can stand and a maximum temperature they can take. They prefer to exist at a particular temperature however. For humans the preferred temp is 37&deg; C (98.6&deg; F). We can tolerate colder temperatures before a person freezes to death. Higher temperatures however cause trouble faster. Someone with a temperature of 101&deg; F is sick, someone with a temperature of 105&deg; F is in the hospital, at 107&deg; F you&#39;re in intensive care and nearly dead. Cooling slows down metabolism, Heating will stop it altogether.</p>
<p>Organisms can be placed into 3 large groups based on preferred growth temperatures. These are not strict cutoffs though, there is some overlap. Temperatures are in degrees Celsius.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Psychrophiles</strong> grow between.... 0 - 15&deg; C</li>
	<li><strong>Mesophiles</strong> grow between...... 15 - 50&deg; C</li>
	<li><strong>Thermophiles</strong> grow between... 50 - 80&deg; C</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Extreme thermophiles</strong> can even thrive at near boiling temperatures!</p>
<p>The <strong>psychrotrophs</strong> are an interesting group. They fit in between psychrophiles and mesophiles. These organisms include Staph and Listeria and are important because they can grow on food in the refrigerator and cause food poisoning. Just because it&#39;s in the fridge does not mean you can keep in there indefinitely (sorry guys).&nbsp;</p>

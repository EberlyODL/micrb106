<p><b>Counting Bacteria</b></p>
<p>In order to talk about populations of bacteria, it&#39;s necessary to count them. There are a number of ways to count microorganisms. One of the most direct, (and tedious) ways to count bacteria is to put them under a microscope and count them one at a time. This is done to count Red Blood Cells for patients that have anemia and a similar process can be used for bacteria. This will not tell you which ones are alive and which ones are dead though. Also, it&#39;s possible to take a culture and dry it out to make a powder. The dry weight can then give an approximation of how many cells there are.</p>

<p>Another method that&#39;s often used is taking a measurement of turbidity. When bacteria grow in a broth medium they divide rapidly as we discussed. The more bacteria, the more cloudy the solution becomes. Machines called Spectrophotometers commonly used in chemistry labs can measure the turbidity or cloudiness of the test tube. There are other machines, cleverly called Cell Counters, that pass a very narrow stream of fluid through a laser beam. The stream is so narrow the cells are essentially passing through in single file. Each time a cell breaks the laser beam it&#39;s counted. The problem with all of these methods is that none of them allow us to easily count LIVING cells. There&#39;s no way to tell which cells are alive and which are dead.</p>

<p>The most useful way to count living cells is to perform a <strong>Plate Count</strong> or place a solution onto an agar plate and count the number of colonies that form. Remember each colony represents a living cell that multiplied into a big pile. The problem is that every milliliter of media may contain billions or trillions of cells. No one wants to count a billion colonies even if you could fit them all onto a single plate. The solution is to <strong>Dilute</strong> the original sample a million times. Then when media containing the bacteria is placed onto the plate you&#39;re only dealing with a hundred or so colonies. After that a bit of math will be needed to calculate the original undiluted sample.</p>

<p><strong>pH</strong> is another factor that restricts the growth of microorganisms. Human cells require a blood pH of about 7.2 or so to sustain life. Bacteria are able to tolerate wide ranges of pH. Most also grow at near neutral pH but some can tolerate a lower, more acidic level. Some bacterial live quite happily inside your fairly acidic stomach!</p>
<p><strong>Osmotic Pressure</strong> effects the growth of microorganisms. The cell wall structure of bacterial enables them to resist the forces in a hypotonic environment. They are less able to deal with a hypertonic environment. Some organisms like Staphylococcus can handle a higher salt environment, they are called <strong>salt tolerant</strong>. Other organisms are actually adapted to living in high salt concentrations. Such organisms are called <strong>Halophiles</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Atmospheric Pressure</strong> can also be a factor that affects bacterial growth. Since organisms are found in virtually every environment on the planet it should not be surprising to know that some are adapted to living at extreme pressures. Bacteria can be found near the ocean floor where pressures are very high. Such organisms are called <strong>Barophiles</strong>.</p>
<p>We manipulate the environment of bacteria all the time to prevent their growth. This is especially true in food preservation. Canned food is first heated to destroy bacteria and then sealed in containers without oxygen. Some foods have a naturally low pH that prevents spoilage. Orange juice and yogurt are examples. Prior to the days of refrigeration it was common practice to salt beef and pork for long term storage. Of course keeping foods cool also slows growth but one can&#39;t keep milk forever either.&nbsp;</p>

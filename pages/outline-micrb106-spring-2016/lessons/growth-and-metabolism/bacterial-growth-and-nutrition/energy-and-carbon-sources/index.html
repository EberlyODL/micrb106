<p>All living cells have minimal requirements they absolutely must. These essential elements include:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<li>Carbon</li>
	<li>Hydrogen</li>
	<li>Nitrogen</li>
	<li>Oxygen</li>
	<li>Phosphorous</li>
	<li>Sulfur</li>
</ul>
<p>Living cells require both an energy source and a source of carbon to build the necessary components for all cell structures.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>Carbon can come from one of two sources, either the breakdown of organic material or from the air.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A <strong>Heterotroph</strong> gets organic carbon from the breakdown of other organic matter.</li>
		<li>An <strong>Autotroph</strong> takes CO2 from the air, keeps the Carbon and releases the Oxygen.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Energy is acquired from one of two sources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A<b><font color="#ff0000"> </font></b><strong>Phototroph</strong> gathers light energy from the sun using chlorophyll.</li>
		<li>A <strong>Chemotroph</strong> gets energy through the breakdown of organic molecules like sugar.</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These terms are mixed together in 4 ways to describe the characteristics of living organisms. For example, a plant would be a <strong>PhotoAutotroph</strong>, they take energy from the sun and Carbon from CO2 in the air. You are a <strong>ChemoHeterotroph</strong>. Microorganisms can be found as examples in every group.</p>

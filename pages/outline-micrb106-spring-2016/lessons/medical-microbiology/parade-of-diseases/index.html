<p>At this stage of the semester, enough information has been presented to finally understand the key features of all the significant human pathogens. Starting with how cells work and features of bacterial cells we then discussed how bacteria grow and carry out metabolism. Then we developed an understanding of the genetic traits bacteria have and how they are passed on to other cells.</p>
<p>Next we had a look at how to control microbial growth in the environment around us and even inside of use through the use of antibiotics. Next we sought to understand how the immune system defends us, how microbes overcome those defenses to cause infections and even how these diseases progress through the human population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You know enough now to really have a good look at each of the disease causing pathogens that cause serious harm to humans. There are far too many disease causing organisms to cover in an introductory course like this. However, the next lessons will cover some of the common ones or some of the more insidious disease causing bacteria.&nbsp;</p>

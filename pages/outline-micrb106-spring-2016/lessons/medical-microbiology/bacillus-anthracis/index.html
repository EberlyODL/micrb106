<p>This organism is responsible for <strong>anthrax</strong> disease. Bacillus anthracis is a gram positive, endospore forming, soil organism. While the endospore does not make it a pathogen, it does make it difficult to control. Once anthrax spores are present in the environment they are nearly impossible to eradicate. Any place an animal has died of anthrax, the spores are released into the soil and are blown about in the wind. The virulence factors associated with this disease are a capsule that it makes and a potent exotoxin that causes massive tissue damage. Only strains with the capsule and toxin produce disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Human anthrax is classified according to portal of entry. There is a cutaneous form, an inhaled form and a gastrointestinal version of the disease. In the <strong>cutaneous</strong> form the endospores enter through a break in the skin. A simple insect bite can introduce the organism in this way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once through the skin the spores become vegetative cells and begin to reproduce and secrete the exotoxin. This first forms a pimple on the skin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a larger vesicle forms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This vesicle soon become hemorrhagic and bluish-black.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally it ruptures and dries into a sharp edged, swollen ulcer with a dark center called a black <strong>Eschar</strong>. This is the class sign of anthrax. Only in rare cases will the organism gain entry into the bloodstream. If you&#39;re going to have anthrax, the cutaneous form is the one you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>inhalation</strong> form of anthrax is another matter. Called woolsorters disease, when someone comes into contact with animals or animal skins and dusty conditions, the spores can be inhaled into the lungs. (A local man in a ska band came down with a case of cutaneous anthrax a few years ago. He imported rare animal skins for his bongo drums which were contaminated. Luckily for him it was not an inhalation case.) Once the spores are in the lungs they germinate, destroy the tissue of the lungs and gain entry to the bloodstream. From there the bacillus can form lesions in just about any organ of the body. This ususally leads to death. <strong>Gastrointestinal</strong> anthrax comes from the ingestion of contaminated meat. Once inside the organism may reach the bloodstream with the same results as the inhaled form. Mortality rates are about 50%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the variation in mortality rates relates to the disease being very treatable if caught early on. The cutaneous form is very obvious and anyone with a lesion that scary looking seeks help. Given immediately, antibiotics do an excellent job. The inhaled and gastrointestinal forms often appear as other illnesses. Doctors have a dozen options when it comes to a lung infection, worrying about anthrax is about the last thing they consider. Thus the real cause goes unrecognized until it&#39;s too late.</p>
<p>Cases of anthrax are typically seen in states along the Gulf coast, midwest and California. It is not terribly common, a few thousand cases per year worldwide. The vast majority of cases (95%) are cutaneous and almost entirely tied to people working in agriculture and ranching.</p>
<p>While there is a vaccine available it is almost exclusively used by military personnel and civilian contractors working in the biowarfare defense arena. Anthrax is a potential biowarfare and bioterror agent due to the lethality and difficulty in eradicating it from an office building. However, it is really only dangerous if inhaled. Most of the work on weaponizing it centers on creating a fine enough dust to get into the air to be inhaled. While any first year microbiology student could isolate and grow anthrax in a lab, turing it into an aerosolized weapon is extraordinarily difficult. So far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most common Staphylococcal lesion is a localized abcess on the skin. Often starting out as folliculitis (inflammation of a hair follicle), the infection can move to deeper tissues leading to a larger lesion like a furuncle or carbuncle. These may need to be lanced to drain the pus from the lesion. Another skin infection is <strong>Cellulitis</strong>, an inflammation of the dermis and subcutaneous skin layers. Such an infection often comes with pain, tenderness and swelling. Finally, Staphs can combine with certain Streptococci to cause <strong>Impetigo</strong>,&nbsp;characterized by&nbsp;easily spread, contagious skin lesions.</p>
<p>Sometimes an infection localized in another location will lead to a more serious skin condition called <strong>Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome</strong>. Some strains of Staph aureus contain phage DNA that includes the gene for Exfoliative toxin. When this toxin is released systemically, it leads to blistering and loosening of the skin across wide patches of the body. Most often seen in newborns, the baby almost resembles a burn patient as portions of the skin peel off.</p>
<p><strong>Toxic Shock Syndrome </strong>was orginally characterized in the 1970&#39;s due to an unknown illness in women using a certain brand of tampon. Now known to be caused by a Staphylococcus infection, anyone can show the signs of TSS. The CDC defines this as a patient exibiting a sudden high fever, sunburn like rash, peeling of skin on the hands and feet, low blood pressure and multisytem organ failure. While a treatable condition, this type of infection can overwhelm body defenses quickly so rapid detection is necessary.</p>
<p>Staphylococcal food poisonings are cause by ingestion of a preformed toxin and are therefore considered an intoxication event, not an infection. The incubation period is short for an intoxication, anywhere from one to 8-10 hours long. Symptoms include nausea, violent vomiting and diarrhea. There is no fever involved and recovery is typically rapid. This sort of food poisoning is often mistaken for some kind of food that "didn&#39;t agreee" with a person. Thus, this sort of food poisoning often goes unreported.&nbsp;</p>

What is diffusion?&nbsp;<strong>Diffusion</strong>&nbsp;describes the movement of atoms from one place to another. What makes a molecule want to go anywhere? Molecules (like people) don&#39;t like to be tightly packed together. They tend to spread out until they&#39;re uniformly distributed throughout an enclosed space. The next time you find yourself in a room full of people, look around to see if most people are clustered in one part of the room with lots of empty seats all around.</p>

The more things that are packed in, the more concentrated they are. But concentration isn&#39;t just how many things you have, it depends on the space. We can talk about the number of students in a room. Say 30 students in a big room vs a small room. Which is more concentrated, 10 students in a small closet or 100,000 people in a large stadium? It&#39;s not necessarily an obvious answer.</p>

Place a drop of food coloring or ink into a glass of water and see what happens over time. Initially the ink drop is very concentrated but slowly the ink molecules move away from the initial spot into adjacent areas where there are fewer ink molecules. They move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. That&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Diffusion</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes we talk about something being concentrated in one place but less concentrated nearby as a concentration gradient. Students often form concentration gradients in classrooms. If you were to look into a class, you would probably find that there are more people in the back of the room than in the front. When molecules move from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration we say they are<em><strong> moving down the concentration gradient</strong></em>.</p>

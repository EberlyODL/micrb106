<p>The total number of chromosomes a cell has varies by the species of the organism. Some species have more chromosomes than another. That does not mean an organism with more chromosomes has more genes however. Chimpanzees and potatoes both have 48 chromosomes but the chimpanzee has more genes. It&rsquo;s just that the potato has its genome broken up into smaller parts. The chromosomes are a bit smaller.</p>

<p>Bacteria are not represented here as they only have a single chromosome and sometimes smaller circular bits of DNA called <strong>plasmids</strong>. Viruses are even worse, they may only carry a handful of genes altogether.&nbsp;</p>

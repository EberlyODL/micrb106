<p>The transport mechanisms outlined so far all deal with moving materials across the membrane one molecule at a time. There are other methods for&nbsp;<em><strong>moving bulk amounts of molecules across the membrane</strong></em>. These two special cases of membrane transport describe the exact same mechanism, they are defined by which direction things are moving. When cells bring molecules into the cell we call it&nbsp;<strong>Endocytosis</strong>. When cells expel material to the&nbsp;exterior of the&nbsp;membrane it&#39;s called<strong>&nbsp;Exocytosis</strong>.</p>

<h2>Endocytosis</h2>
<p>Endocytosis begins when the membrane gets dimpled or pushed in just a bit. The molecules of interest collect in this depression of the membrane. The dimple is made deeper until the upper part is pinched off trapping the material inside a tiny ball of plasma membrane. This ball of membrane is called a vesicle.</p>
<h2>Exocytosis</h2>
<p>Exocytosis is the same process but in reverse. The cell produces some molecule and stores it in one of the vesicles found inside the cell. This vesicle moves to the membrane and makes contact with it. The vesicle membrane fuses with the cellular membrane and a hole forms. This allows the contents of the vesicle to leave the cell. The vesicle itself is absorbed into the membrane and can participate in Endocytosis later on.</p>

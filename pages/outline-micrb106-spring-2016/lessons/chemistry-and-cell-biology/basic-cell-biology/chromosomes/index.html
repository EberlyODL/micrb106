<p style="text-align: justify;">All living organisms contain some form of genetic material, often organized into a structure that contains all the information necessary for the survival of the organism. All of the genetic information carried by cells is stored in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells on large structures called <strong>Chromosomes</strong>. The chromosomes are extremely long strings of DNA that are tightly packed together into a structure that is visible when the cell undergoes division.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The rest of the time these chromosomes are unwound and not visible under a regular microscope. The entire collection of all the genetic information of an organism is called the <strong>Genome</strong>. The Human Genome consists of close to 25,000 genes encoded by 3 Billion base pairs in 46 Chromosomes. The Human Genome project has been attempting over the past decade, to map all of the genes in humans. So you have 25,000 of them but what&#39;s a gene anyway?</p>

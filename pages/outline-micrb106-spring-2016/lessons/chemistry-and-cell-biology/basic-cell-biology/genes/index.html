<p>A <strong>Gene</strong> is a genetic unit of heredity. The term is used in a variety of different ways. Sometimes genes are used to discuss certain physical characteristics. An athlete may be said to have good genes for speed or endurance. It&#39;s a way of describing an innate ability. It can also be used to describe physical appearance. That person is so good looking and smart because they come from good genetic stock (meaning their parents are cute and intelligent).</p>

<p>Scientists talk about genes as coding for information that tells a cell to produce something in particular. If muscle cells grow in a certain way, produce certain products, they can make strong contractions for a long time which makes for a good athlete. A good athlete has good cells because the genes make them that way. (Of course training is important too.)</p>
<p>A gene then codes for the production of a certain protein that can function as an enzyme. Enzymes do chemistry; the chemistry gives a cell certain features which allow the whole body to take on a characteristic. Hair color and eye color are controlled by genes producing enzymes carrying out chemistry to make for blue eyes and blond hair.</p>
<p>Not all genes are equal. Everyone has two copies of each gene. We got one set from Mom and another set from Dad. Now both sets have all the same genes but each gene isn&#39;t necessarily identical. For example if hair color was controlled by one gene and all genes were equal, wouldn&#39;t everyone have the same hair? Why the differences?</p>
<p>It&#39;s because each copy of the gene you have can code for a slight variation. One hair color gene may code for blond the other may code for brunette. Which one you become depends on a set of rules worked out by a fellow named Gregor Mendel, but more on him later. Each copy of a gene is called an <strong>Allele</strong>. One hair color allele codes for blonde, the other allele codes for brunette.</p>
<p>Sometimes alleles can vary not because they code for different variations but because one form can be a functioning gene and the other can be a defective one. For example there are two alleles for cystic fibrosis. One is considered a functioning gene the other is a malfunctioning one. Turns out you need to have <em>two</em> malfunctioning genes to have the disease. With two defective genes all of your cells don&#39;t function properly and you&#39;ll have a life threatening illness. Even if you only have one allele that&#39;s good it&#39;s enough so you won&#39;t have the disease, however, you can pass that trait on to your children.</p>
<p>Bacteria are different than we are in that they only have one, circular chromosome. The idea of multiple alleles does not come into play in organisms that only have one copy of each gene. On the other hand, bacteria are far more adept at picking up genes from other sources that allows them to change their characteristics immediately. Our cells simple don&#39;t do that, we&#39;re more restricted in some way than even simple bacteria.</p>

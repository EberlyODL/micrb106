<p>There are three types of lipids: fatty acids, triglycerides, and phospholipids.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fatty acids</strong>: Long carbon chains (C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C-C). They come in many different lengths, there are many different fatty acids. They are non-polar (hydrophobic), so they clump together in water (oil and water don&#39;t mix.)</li>
	<li><strong>Triglyceride</strong>: Three fatty acids linked by <strong>glycerol</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Phospholipid</strong>:&nbsp; Remove one fatty acid from Triglyceride and add a Phosphorous instead. Phospholipids organize themselves in water in unique ways. They are partly non-polar (long tails) and partly polar (the phosphorous end).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li>Because of this they organize together in unique ways - they form a <strong>Bilayer</strong> or a <strong>Micelle</strong> (round ball).</li>
	<li>Phospholipids are used to construct cell membranes.</li>
</ul>

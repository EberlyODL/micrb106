It mostly strikes during the winter months from November to March. Some years there is little impact other years the impact is quite substantial. Two things impact the severity of a given flu season: the virulence of the strain and the immunological status of the population.</p>
<p>Some flu strains are intrinsicly more virulent than others. They may spread more efficiently as an airborne virus or they may have a greater ability to cause an infection. Some are capable of causing significant tissue destruction.</p>
<p>The ability to cause epidemics is a combination of changes in the antigenic structure and the subsequent loss if host immunity. When a strain of the flu goes around, many people get it and get better. This builds up an immunity in the individual and the herd immunity of the population increases. The higher the herd immunity the less likely it is that an epidemic will occurr even though many individuals can still get sick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a virus changes it&#39;s antigenic strucure (antigenic shift) herd immunity essentially restarts back at zero. No one is immune and the virus has a vast supply of hosts so it can spread and spread and spread. Since almost all of the people who were alive as children during the 1918 pandemic are now gone, the entire human population of the earth is once again susceptible to that same virus strain. Our herd immunity against it has vanished.</p>
<p>Outbreaks of Influenza often start in children and then spread to adults over a several week period. The outbreak can then last for several months. Roughly 10-20% of a susceptible population will come down with the infection however, in an epidemic that number can reach 50%!!</p>
<p>Since so many people get sick (even though relatively few die) the impact is still tremendous. In a "good" year 75 million work days and 50 million school days are lost and 100,000 people will require hospitalization. During a pandemic year those numbers will double or triple! In normal years deaths due to influenza are mostly restricted to only those adults who are at high risk; the elderly or those with medical problems that will lead to complications like pneumonia. During pandemic years 50% of all deaths will be among those under 65 years old.&nbsp;</p>

Going out in crowds increases the chances for transmission. Since it&#39;s an airborne virus simply being in a room with someone who&#39;s coughing can lead to exposure. In the past, many have turned to masks in an attempt to prevent releasing the virus into the air. Such methods surely help but are not totally preventative.</p>
<p>Common sense ideas will help. Wash your hands and don&#39;t rub your eyes. Keep healthy, eat right get some sleep and try to reduce stress. Get the flu shot. It won&#39;t protect against all flu strains but it&#39;s at least better than being wide open to everything. Refrain from smoking which causes tissue damage in your lungs making it easier for an infection to get started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for a flu virus to cause a pandemic it needs to meet some criteria. It has to be easily passed from person to person. It has to be a variety that has not been seen in humans before. The avian H5N1 virus is unique in that humans have never been exposed to the HA5 antigen before, thus we have no immunity to it. Fortunately there have been no cases of human to human transmission. Everyone who&#39;s had it got from exposure to bird or chicken feces. (Tip: don&#39;t eat bird feces!)</p>

<p>This is an acute fever causing disease that is typically self limiting. That means a person gets it and usually recovers. Only immunocomprimised patients (the eldery, diabetics or HIV patients) typically fall prey to the illness. The CDC recommends the following people get flu shots each year:</p>
<ul>
	<li>any one over 50 years old</li>
	<li>anyone with chronic medical conditions</li>
	<li>very young children</li>
	<li>pregnant women</li>
	<li>all healthcare providers</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a virus, influenza specifically targets host cells in the epithelial lining of the respiratory tract. After a week antibodies are produced against the HA and NA antigens. Cell mediated immunity is also important to destroy any remaining infected cells to break the reproductive cycle of the virus.</p>

<p>Any deaths are almost always attributable to secondary bacterial infections that get out of hand. Certain strains are an exception to this. Normally bacteria like Stap aureus or Strep pneumonia will also set up shop and lead to a lethal lung infection. Minor infections can also develop like ear infections or croup in children. Antibiotics are not effective on the virus itself but can be used to treat bacterial pneumonia complications.</p>
<p>Vaccines are a first line of defence. Viruses do mutate however and it take a solid 6 months to get a new one produced. Of course that&#39;s <em>after</em> it&#39;s developed in the first place. Development can take months to years depending on the biology of the virus. There are a handful of antiviral medications that are effective, even on the (H5N1) avian flu strain.</p>
<p>Tamiflu is one such drug. The US government is in the process of procuring 2 million doses for use during a possible pandemic. Unfortunately it&#39;s estimated that 100 million doses would be needed. All Tamiflu is produced by a single company, the Swiss giant Roche and a dozen other governments had placed an order ahead of the US. We&#39;re somewhere in line waiting. Another drug Relenza may be equally effective and companies are scrambling to develop others.</p>

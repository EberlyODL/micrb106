<p>The so called avian flu was first seen in 1997 in Hong Kong. It&#39;s an Influenza A virus (H5N1) that had only been seen in birds at this point in time. It infected 18 people and 6 died making this a flu strain with a 33% mortality rate (in this instance). A massive effort was made to destroy all birds in Hong Kong and a major pandemic was avoided. At the time the virus was not passed from one peron to another easily and the human flu was not widely present to provide a chance for gene reassortment.</p>
<p>The virus reemerged in 2003, again in Hong Kong with two persons infected who had recently been to mainland China. Since then it has spread to the near east, Africa and parts of eastern Europe. By March of 2006 outbreaks of Influenza A (H5N1) have been reported in SE asia, China, Turkey and Iraq. The virus has been found in chickens and ducks as well as pigs and domesticated cats.</p>
<p>The current strain is resistant to 2 of the 4 most useful antiviral drugs on the market. There are no vaccines available for this strain of the flu although companies are racing to develop one.</p>
<p>Human infections have been seen in Asia, Turkey and Iraq but the cases of human to human transmission are very rare. Currently no viruses of the Type A (H5N1) variety have been found with both avian and human infection genes. The current fear is that this flu strain could mutate into one that would become a worldwide pandemic. All it lacks is the ability to jump from one human to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with the avian flu is that it&#39;s particularly deadly, it has a fairly high mortality rate. To date, 138 people have been infected with this virus but half of them did not survive it. In a worldwide pandemic estimates range from tens of millions to hundreds of millions could become infected. And keep in mind, half could die, two million in the US alone.</p>
<p>So how could this come about? Bird flu and human flu strains normally do not infect the opposite species. The current avian flu seems to be something of an exception in that humans CAN get bird flu but it takes a particularly large exposure. Even if a human is infected with the avian (H5N1) strain it cannot be passed directly to another human. Human flu strains have the genes required to be an airborne pathogen that can jump from one human to another.</p>
<p>The fear is that the fairly deadly avian strain will incorporate the genes from a human strain and essentially change overnight into a serious human pathogen. But how can these two strains that infect different species ever come together in a host to exchange gene? The answer lies in pigs. Some species are capable of being host to flu strains of multiple species. Human flu and avian flu can both exist quite happily together. If the genes are able to recombine in pigs a human communicable avian flu strain could jump to humans and then race through the population.</p>

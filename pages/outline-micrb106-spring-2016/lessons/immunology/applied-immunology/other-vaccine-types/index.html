<h3>Component or Subunit Vaccines</h3>
<p>The most recent and arguably the best vaccine option involves the injection of an intact part of the infectious agent. A component vaccine uses only a part of the agent not the whole intact, reproducing agent. For example the capsid protein coat of a virus would serve as an antigen but since no nucleic acid is present it cannot possibly reproduce and cause an illness. Yet the immune system gets a good look at an intact antigen. Many times these antigen parts are proteins that are made through genetic engineering. Thus, component vaccines are often called <strong>Recombinant Vaccines</strong>, since they are made using recombinant DNA technology. This process was discussed in the unit on Biotechnology.</p>
<p>These vaccines are very safe and quite effective. They have the bonuses of the earlier vaccines without the dangers involved. The problem is that producing them via genetic engineering is a slow process. Current examples include the Hepatitis B vaccine.</p>

<h3>DNA Vaccines</h3>
<p>The latest generation of vaccines evolved from failed gene therapy experiments. In an attempt to induce growth hormone production in mice, one gene therapy experiment induced the production of antibodies. Scientists seized upon this unexpected result and are now trying to produce genetically engineered DNA that can be injected into a host to produce antigen proteins directly.</p>
<p>Remember in gene therapy the idea is to insert a desirable gene into a vector (virus or plasmid) and inject that vector into a host animal. The hope is that cells will take up the gene and begin producing the gene protein throughout the body. Here the gene is not growth hormone or insulin but rather a component of a disease causing organism you want to protect against. Rather than giving a component vaccine which may require boosters, here genes are inserted so the cells produce a continuous supply of antigen which should strongly provoke an immune response. Recently the FDA halted an experimental HIV vaccine because is proved to be ineffective but this is the sort of thing they&#39;re working towards.&nbsp;</p>

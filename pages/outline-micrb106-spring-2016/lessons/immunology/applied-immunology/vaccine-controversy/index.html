<p>The great advancement in medicine that the use of vaccines represents is not appreciated by everyone. Smallpox no longer exists in nature, few die of Polio, Diptheria, Tetanus, or Whooping cough anymore. Many people are unaware of how significantly the use of vaccines has reduced the yearly incidence of many diseases. This data is for the US alone and will vary in other countries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Annual number of Diptheria cases in 1920 - 176,000, &nbsp;Today: not one since 2003</p>
<p>Annual number of Whooping cough cases in 1940 - 148,000, &nbsp;Today: 6000 cases</p>
<p>Annual number of Polio cases in 1954 - 35,000, Today: not one since 1979</p>
<p>Annual number of Measles cases in 1960 - 500,000, Today: 200</p>
<p>It&#39;s estimated that the vaccine for whooping cough saves half a million lives a year. It is even now recommended for adults to recieve a booster shot as immunitiy seems to wane over the years. Many of these diseases are much more prevalent in developing nations without an effective vaccine program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the face of this evidence, there are some who, (including celebrities who shall not be named here)&nbsp;fueled by junk science on the internet, fear and refuse to vaccinate their children even though many places require it by law. There is a robust anti-vaccine movement in the US and Europe&nbsp;where people who mistrust government refuse to participate.</p>
<p>Some claim that vaccines are linked to an increase in the number of Autistic children.&nbsp;The evidence is tenuous at best and mostly relates to a preservative no longer used in vaccine production. There are many different reasons that people use to justify the resistance to vaccinations. Many of them come from people advocating "alternative" medicine and those trying to sell some kind of cure. Lots of it is <a href="http://www.reformation.org/vaccine.html">internet generated hysteria</a> fed by those who do not understand science or medicine very well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One major blow to this movement came a few years ago when the original scientific paper linking vaccines to autism was utterly discredited. The author falsified data so badly that he lost his medical license and the British medical journal The Lancet had to print a full retraction of the paper. Such was the power of the need to blame autism on some cause that it took years for the scientific community to catch up to this shoddy study and discredit it. Even so there are some who still point to "scientific studies" now knowing the scientific community has disavowed this one (and only as it turns out) paper making a link to autism and vaccines. We will be living with this internet myth for years to come. There is no telling how many will die from preventable illnesses while this incorrect information continues to circulate.</p>

<p>The immune system is designed to keep all foreign invaders out of the body. The immune system is quite good at telling self from non-self. It recognizes foreign antigens and then proceeds to destroy them.</p>
<h2>Antigens</h2>
<p>The word antigen literally means "<strong>antibody generator</strong>." Antibodies are immune system proteins that attack invaders, so an antigen is something that these antibodies will attack as non-self. Many things can be antigens including bacteria, viruses, and toxins. Even the ABO blood typing markers can be antigens.</p>
<p>Each and every antigen in existence has a specific<em><strong> 3D shape</strong></em>. The immune system is able to recognize shapes that belong inside the body. It&#39;s like a baby being able to recognize mom or dad by looking at them. Young children are often afraid of any face they don&#39;t recognize. Any shape that the immune system is not accustomed to will be considered a stranger. Many people tell their kids not to talk to strangers. The immune system&nbsp;will target these strange shapes and destroy them.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Pathogens</h2>
<p>The term pathogen<b> </b>refers to an organism capable of causing disease. There are two kinds of pathogens, true pathogens and opportunistic pathogens.</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>True pathogens</strong> are the really nasty organisms that are fully capable of causing illness on its own. It has properties enabling the microbe to overcome body defenses and infect tissues not normally infected.</li>
	<li><strong>Opportunistic pathogens</strong>, on the other hand, cannot make someone sick unless that person had a predisposing condition. Diabetes, cancer, AIDS or even just a bad cold can weaken a person to the point where an opportunistic pathogen can cause illness.</li>
</ol>
<p>The most common invaders are <strong>bacterial</strong> and<strong> viral pathogens</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bacteria</strong>&nbsp;enter the body, multiply and cause damage. The bacteria live in the tissues or blood stream and small numbers can rapidly multiply to cause a major infection.</li>
	<li><strong>Viruses</strong> are different because they are<strong> obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. That means they only multiply if they gain access to some host cell. Viruses cannot replicate by themselves. They are not a complete complex cell like bacteria. A virus gets into a specific cell, takes it over and used the enzymes of the cell to manufacture copies of itself. Once many virus particles are made they break open the host cell, killing it, and release the viruses to infect other cells. The immune system uses different strategies to deal with these two classes of pathogens.</li>

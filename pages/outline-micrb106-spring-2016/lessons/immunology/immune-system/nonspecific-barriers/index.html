<h2>Physical and Chemical Barriers</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Non-specific immune defenses include a number of general barriers that prevent invaders from gaining entry into the body. These are considered nonspecific because they do not target any particular invader, rather <em><strong>they keep everything out</strong></em>. </font></p>

<h2>Skin&nbsp;</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">This is the most important barrier, as it covers all of the internal tissues and keeps bacteria and viruses from gaining entry. The low moisture, mild pH effects, and oily residues all inhibit microbial growth on the surface of the skin. In fact, the places that tend to be moist part of the time, like the feet, are the places where microbes can grow best.</font></p>
<h2>Lysozyme</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">This antibacterial enzyme is found in tears and saliva. It reduces the chances of an infection in the eyes and help to control the growth of bacteria in the oral cavity. </font></p>
<h2>Normal Flora</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Many harmless bacteria live on the skin and in parts of the digestive tract. These harmless bacteria compete for food and space with any pathogens that may be present, thus keeping the more harmful bacteria at low population levels. </font></p>
<h2>Stomach Acid</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">The acid content of the stomach prevents most intestinal illnesses. Few bacteria can pass through the stomach alive and make it to the small intestine to cause disease. </font></p>
<h2>Urinary Tract</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Another access point for invaders is the urinary tract. The low pH and high salt of urine help flush the urinary tract and prevent microbes from moving up into the bladder to cause an infection. Drinking cranberry juice makes urine more acidic and thus more effective at cleansing the tract. </font></p>
<h2>Macrophages</h2>
<p>These immune system cells are found in the tissues and they&#39;re always screening for invaders. Macrophages continually search for anything foreign and then destroy it by a process called <strong>phagocytosis</strong><font color="#000000">. Phagocytosis is a specialized form of endocytosis where foreign material, like a bacterial cell, is brought into the cell and exposed to degradative enzymes to destroy it. </font></p>

<h2>Complement Proteins</h2>
<p>These are a group of proteins found in the bloodstream that can attack bacteria if an antibody is attached to it.</p>
<h2>Lymphokines</h2>
<p>These are chemical signals that include interleukins and interferon. These are signals used by immune system cells to coordinate attacks on foreign invaders.</p>

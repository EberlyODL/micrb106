<p><font color="#000000">The specific immune response targets particular antigens. The immune system has to be able to deal with a variety of problems. These include bacterial and viral infections, bacterial toxins, cancer cells and transplants. The last may seem strange, after all getting a new kidney if the old one quits working should be a good thing. The immune system sees things differently. All it sees is a stranger which must be destroyed. The immune system operates on the principle: better to&nbsp;destroy something useful than ignore a deadly infection. </font></p>
<h2>Pathways</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">There are two pathways used to fight these potential problems:</font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font color="#000000">One is called the <strong>antibody mediated response</strong></font> and involves B-cells and antibodies.</li>
	<li><font color="#000000">The other pathway is called the <strong>cell mediated response</strong></font> and it involves T-cells.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#000000">The pathway that is used depends on the problem encountered. When an invader is circulating in the body fluids, antibodies can be made to target them. Sometimes, though, cells in the body just don&#39;t act or look right, so T-cells will target and destroy them. Specific examples are listed below.</font></p>
<h2>Cases for Antibody Mediated Responses</h2>
<ul>
	<li><font color="#000000">Bacterial or parasitic infections</font></li>
	<li><font color="#000000">Bacterial toxins or toxins from other sources like insect or snake bites</font></li>
	<li><font color="#000000">Viral infections only in the case of a free floating virus particle. Most of the time viruses are inside host cells and cannot be touched by antibodies, but, if they leave the host cell,&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); ">they can be targeted.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Cases for Cell Mediated Responses</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Cells infected by viruses</li>
	<li>Cancer cells</li>
	<li>Transplanted cells</li>
</ul>

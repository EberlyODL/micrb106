<p>The process of an antibody mediated response begins very much like the cell mediated response.</p>
<p>1. Macrophages interact with T-helper cells and activate them. Here the T-helper cells stimulate a specific B cell. Only one will be useful, the one that makes antibodies against the antigen causing the trouble.</p>

<p>2. Once the proper B cell is found and simulated, the cell divides into many exact copies of itself or <strong>clones</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Each cloned B cell then undergoes a maturing process until it becomes a <strong>plasma cell</strong>. The plasma cells are specialized cells, well equipped to produce lots of protein.</p>
<p>4. The plasma cells produce lots and lots of <strong>antibodies</strong>. Each antibody is a protein formed in a very specific shape to bind to an antigen. These antibodies are secreted in large amounts into the bloodstream where they attach to a specific antigen and mark it for destruction.</p>
<p>5. As before, once the infection has been dealt with, many of the cells die off over time. Some hang around for quite awhile producing more antibodies but eventually they fade away. However some remain behind as memory cells so that, if the antigen is encountered again, the whole process will be faster and stronger</p>

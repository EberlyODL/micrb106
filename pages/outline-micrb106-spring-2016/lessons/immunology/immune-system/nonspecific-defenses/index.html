<h2>Acute Inflammation</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Inflammation is caused by some kind of damage that kills cells in a tissue. </font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font color="#000000">If bleeding occurs, clotting mechanisms take over to prevent blood loss. Local chemical signals are released including <strong>Histamine</strong></font>, <strong>Bradykinin</strong>, and <strong>Prostaglandins</strong>. These serve to attract white blood cells through the process of <strong>Chemotaxis</strong>. It&#39;s similar to the way a person will wake up in the morning from the smell of coffee or breakfast and then follow their nose into the kitchen.</li>
	<li><font color="#000000"><strong>Mast cells</strong></font> release <strong>Histamine</strong> which causes <strong>vasodilation</strong>. This increases blood flow through capillaries which become even more leaky causing swelling. This also leads to redness and a warming of the tissue as increased blood flow passes through the damaged tissues. Swelling in mucous membranes leads to an increase in mucous production.&nbsp;Antihistamines are drugs taken to reduce inflammation and clear up a stuffy nose.</li>
	<li>
		<div align="left"><font color="#000000"><strong>Neutrophils </strong></font>accumulate at the damage site. These are the most numerous phagocytic white blood cells which squeeze out of capillaries and attack invaders. They tend to destroy a small number of pathogens and eventually die.</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><font color="#000000">Sometimes the body will produce a barrier of fibrous connective tissue around the site of an injury to wall off the spread of the infection. Eventually this material becomes an <strong>abscess</strong></font> which fills with damaged tissues and dead neutrophils and pus forms. A pimple is an example of a tiny abscess. Normally these will go away as macrophages clean out the area over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interleukin 1</h2>
<p><strong>Macrophages</strong><font color="#000000"> are involved in fighting many infections and aside from phagocytosis, will secrete Interleukin 1.<strong> </strong>This chemical signals other white blood cells to fight the infection. It also induces fever and drowsiness. </font></p>
<ul>
	<li><font color="#000000">The drowsiness effect is to ensure a person rests and conserves energy while fighting an infection. </font></li>
	<li><font color="#000000">The fever caused by interluekin 1 will not directly lead to bacterial death. Brain cells will be long dead before any bacteria begin to think things are getting warm. Fevers of 105-107 degrees F are life threatening to human cells not bacteria. The increased temperature serves to take the bacteria out of their optimal growth conditions. It also increases body metabolism to more rapidly mobilize immune system cells.</font></li>
</ul>
<h2>Bacteria multiply fast...</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Bacteria multiply by doubling their numbers every so many minutes. The population growth is exponential. If bacteria populations double every 10 minutes in two hours a single bacterium will become thousands. In two more hours it will be millions. That&#39;s one to millions in four hours. A fever makes bacteria grow more slowly say every 20 minutes. So in two hours, instead of thousands there will be less than a hundred. In four hours, instead of millions there will only be a couple thousand. That&#39;s the difference between millions and one or two thousand. By slowing the microbes down it dramatically reduces the number of invaders the immune system has to kill. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Antibodies are produced by the B-cells and they circulate through the bloodstream and attach themselves to the antigen they are designed to attack. However the antibody doesn&#39;t do anything by itself. Perhaps it will neutralize a toxin or slow down a virus, but the true benefit for making antibodies stick to antigens is to help mark foreign material for easy phagocytosis. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Macrophages will find and destroy any foreign material in the body on their own, but they do this far more efficiently if the item is tagged with an antibody. It&#39;s like eating plain cereal as a kid. Wheaties or Cheerios were fine but sprinkle some sugar on it and mmmm...good. Antibodies attached to bacteria also help initiate the<strong> </strong></font>complement cascade<font color="#000000">. </font></p>

<h2>Complement Cascade</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Once an antibody is attached to a bacterium, it sets off a sequence of protein interactions called the <strong>complement cascade.</strong> Proteins circulating in the blood are activated and assemble on the surface of the bacterial cell. The end result is a set of membrane penetrating proteins that form a circular hole in the membrane of the bacterial cell. This interferes with the cell&#39;s metabolism or the bacterial cell will lose membrane integrity and burst open, killing it. </font></p>

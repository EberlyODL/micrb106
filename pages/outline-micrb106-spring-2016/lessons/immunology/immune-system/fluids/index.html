<h2>Capillary Structure</h2>
<p>Lymphatic capillaries are made in such a way that fluid can enter them but it cannot leave. The <strong>endothelial cells</strong> overlap to <strong>allow fluid in,</strong><em><strong> not out</strong></em>. <strong>Interstitial fluid</strong> flows in when pressure increases in tissues as fluids accumulate.</p>
<p>These capillaries function like a floor drain in a basement with a leaky washing machine. When the water leaks it gets collected into the drain and is removed before it causes a problem.</p>
<p>Any place in the body where there are capillaries carrying blood, some fluid will leak. All of those places have to also contain lymphatic vessels to carry the excess fluid away. <strong>Avascular&nbsp;<span style="color:#000000;">tissue</span></strong> or tissue lacking blood vessels will also not contain lymphatic vessels. The bone marrow, cartilage&nbsp;or parts of the central nervous system are examples.</p>

<h2>Lymph Flow</h2>
<p>The flow of fluid in the bloodstream cycles in the following way: Blood gets pumped under pressure through blood vessels and some plasma leaks out of capillaries to become interstitial fluid.</p>
<p>The buildup of fluid in the tissues must be prevented. If not it results in swelling or <strong>edema</strong>. The excess fluid gets drained into lymph capillaries and vessels. In addition, any "lost" plasma protein is recovered.</p>
<p>The lymph fluid first enters lymphatic capillaries and then passes through larger vessels by muscle contractions. One-way valves move lymph in one direction just like blood is moved through veins. Along the way the lymph passes through lymph nodes. Finally it is returned to the bloodstream by passing all the filtered lymph into the subclavian vein which enters into the heart.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The genetic code is redundant, meaning&nbsp;more than one codon codes for a given amino acid. When changes are made to the sequence of the letters it changes what the codon looks like. This may or may not cause a problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A common form of a mutation involves the switching of a single letter in the DNA sequence to another letter. Sometimes DNA and RNA polymerases make mistakes when matching letters and use the wrong pairing pattern. While a T should pair with an A, sometimes a C or G is inserted instead. This is called a point mutation and they have wide ranging effects, as shown below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on which letter of a three-letter codon is altered, different changes can happen. Since the genetic code is redundant, changing a specific codon to a different codon, that still&nbsp;calls for the insertion of the same amino acid won&rsquo;t change the end protein one bit. This is a <strong>Neutral mutation</strong>. The&nbsp;codon changes, but the same amino acid is used&nbsp;so there is no real change made.&nbsp;However, if changing in one codon to a different one ends with a change in the amino acid used, this is called a <strong>Missense mutation</strong>. The last and most serious point mutation is a <strong>Nonsense mutation</strong>. Here a codon that codes for a given amino acid is changed into a stop codon. Depending on where this happens along the chain, a premature stop codon can terminate a protein before it&rsquo;s half completed. Such a protein is highly unlikely to function properly.</p>

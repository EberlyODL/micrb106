<p>The Genetics unit is one of the more complex parts of the course. This unit has been broken up into 3 parts. Molecular genetics will describe the basic genetic processes all cells undergo every day. Once the basic process is understood it is then possible to discuss what happens when these processes have errors, it leads to mutation. The final section discusses issues specific to bacteria, how they are able to exchange and acquire new genetic information from their neighbors. A little extra time will be needed to adequately cover this particular unit.&nbsp;</p>

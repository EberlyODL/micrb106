<p>Bacteria are especially well suited to live in a wide variety of environments. They exist in all corners of the planet. To live in such a wide variety of places they have to develop appropriate genes to gain an edge in survival. As a result bacteria are capable of acquiring and using new genes. They do this in a number of ways.</p>
<p>When an organism acquires a new capability it comes from either a mutation in an existing gene which gives an advantage or they "steal" a gene from somewhere else. <strong>Recombination</strong> occurs when an organism incorporates some DNA from another source. Essentially two bits of DNA are merged to become a new piece of information. The new DNA is called a <strong>Recombinant</strong>. This process is an efficient way to gain an advantage as the new characteristic is simply adopted. With mutation, the new gene could either be enhanced or destroyed.&nbsp;</p>

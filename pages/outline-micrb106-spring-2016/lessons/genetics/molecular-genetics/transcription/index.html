<p>The process of Transcription is somewhat similar to the process of DNA replication in that the double stranded DNA is first separated by a Helicase. Then one of the two possible strands of DNA is copied by a polymerase enzyme. When complete, the DNA helix is restored after having copied a gene from the DNA molecule.</p>
<p>There are a couple of important differences though. The enzyme used in Transcription to copy from the DNA is called <strong>RNA Polymerase</strong> since we are now making an RNA strand, not a DNA one. The RNA polymerase is making a single stranded copy of the DNA but it is making this single strand out of RNA. The resulting RNA strand is called a <strong>Messenger RNA</strong> or <strong>mRNA</strong>.</p>
<p>Another difference seen here is the introduction of a 5th base. When the RNA polymerase sees an A on the DNA strand it matches up a different nucleotide. Instead of the normal T that would be inserted the polymerase inserts a <strong>U (or uracil)</strong> nucleotide. There are no T&rsquo;s in a messenger RNA strand; U&rsquo;s are used instead.</p>

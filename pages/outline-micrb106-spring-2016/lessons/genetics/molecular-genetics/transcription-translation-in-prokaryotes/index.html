<p>Unlike eukaryotes, bacteria and other prokaryotes do not have a separate storage area for chromosomes. In eukaryotes, transcription takes place in the nucleus and translation takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum. Bacteria do not have these structures to there is no real reason for transcription and translation to take place in separate locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turn out, these two processes can be directly linked in prokaryotes. Even before transcription ends and the mRNA is finished, ribosomes can attach to the free end and begin with translation. Once the first ribosome moves some distance along the mRNA another one can start translating. Eventually a whole chain of ribosomes can be in the process of translating the mRNA before the mRNA is even completed. The process looks something like a series of railroad cars moving along a rail line, each one in different stages of completing translation.&nbsp;</p>

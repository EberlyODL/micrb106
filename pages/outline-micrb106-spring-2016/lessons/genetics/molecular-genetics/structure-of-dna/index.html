<p>DNA is a double stranded molecule made up of chains of nucleotides. There are 4 nucleotides: A, T, C and G. Each strand is connected to the other by hydrogen bonds that link A to T and C to G. This double stranded structure then coils to form the Double Helix shape much like a spiral staircase.</p>

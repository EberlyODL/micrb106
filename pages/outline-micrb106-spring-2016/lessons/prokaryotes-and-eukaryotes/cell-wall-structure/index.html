<p>Bacteria have a unique cell wall structure that helps them protect their cellular membrane from damage in unfavorable conditions. While your cells are carefully papmered with just the right temperature and pH level and osmotic pressure, bacterial live, well, everywhere. Their outer structure needs to be a little bit stronger to resist the hypotonic environment they typically live in. Without some strengthening the cell membrane would burst. Like plants, bacteria have a cell wall structure outside of the main plasma membrane. However, plant cell walls are quite different from bacterial cell walls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bacteria are surrounded by a layer of <strong>Peptidoglycan</strong>. This consists of long chains of carbohydrate units called G and M (the actual names are much harder to remember) These carbohydrate chains have protein side chains linking them together. This forms a chain link fence type of structure that surrounds the entire cell.</p>

<p>The cell wall is a major point of attack when trying to control the growth of bacteria. Antibiotics like Penicillin cut holes in this protective layer, leaving the cells open to lysis. The enzyme <strong>lysozyme</strong> found in tears and saliva also breaks down the peptidoglycan layer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some bacteria have even more unique cell wall structures. Some species like the <strong>Mycobacteria</strong>, contain unique long chain fatty acids, <strong>mycolic acid</strong> actually, that are easily identified by staining techniques. The <strong>acid fast stain</strong> is used to identify these bacteria which cause tuberculosis and leprosy.</p>
<p>A handful of bacterial species do not have a cell wall structure at all. <strong>Mycoplasmas</strong> have a unique membrane that is resistant to lysis without the need for a layer of peptidoglycan. These bacteria are extremely small, vary is shape and cause diseases like pneumonia which are hard to diagnose and treat.&nbsp;</p>

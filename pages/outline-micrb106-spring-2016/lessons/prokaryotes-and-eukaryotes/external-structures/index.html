<p>Bacteria have a number of cell surface components that differ in look and function. Some of these are for locomotion as bacteria often are found in liquid environments. Others help bacteria attach to surfaces, while still others are protective in nature. These different structures are discussed below.</p>
<h3>Flagella</h3>
<p>Some bacteria have long filamentous appendages sticking out of them called Flagella. These structures rotate and function as a propeller screw to move bacteria along in liquid environments. A cell with this ability is said to be <strong>motile</strong>. Bacteria can have one or many flagella and they can be located in different patterns around the cell.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motility provided by flagella allow bacteria to move around in the environment in search of nutrients. They swim in one direction for a period of time based on the conditions at hand. If they&#39;re swimming in the right direction, they head that way for a longer period of time. If they sense they&#39;re going the wrong way they reverse the propeller, tumble around and then head out in a new, random direction. In this way they zig zag around heading ever closer to the most favorable environment. This type of movement is called a <strong>random walk</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Fimbria</h3>
<p>These are smaller appendages found all over the surface of some bacteria that allow them to attach to surfaces. The fimbria will stick to just about anything from other bacteria in biofilms to surfaces such as epithelial tissue or glass and plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pili</h3>
<p>These are also long appendages like flagella but they have a function more similar to fimbria. Some pili allow cells to anchor to surfaces like a grappling hook. The most common function of pili is to connect two bacterial cells together in the process of <strong>bacterial conjugation</strong>. In this process bacteria are able to share DNA with each other. This will be discussed further in the Genetics lesson.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Glycolax</h3>
<p>The glycolax layer forms when cells are in harsh environments or when they need to adhere to a surface. It consists of a matrix of carbohydrates and protein, different species have different recipes for this material. If a cell has a general layer of this goop that is not particularly well defined it&#39;s called a <strong>Slime Layer</strong>. A well organized layer of uniform thickness all around is called a <strong>Capsule</strong>. Pathogenic bacteria rely on a capsule to protect them from the immune system. It&#39;s a significant defense mechanism our immune system cannot overcome&nbsp;in many cases of serious illness. While not all pathogens make a capsule, many of the really nasty ones do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aside from protection, the glycolax allows bacteria to stick to surfaces and form multi species&nbsp;collectives with other bacteria leading to the creation of a <strong>biofilm</strong>. These are very common in nature where there is a complex interaction going on between all the different species of organisms present. Biofilms can present some significant health hazards when they form on implanted medical devices like catheters or heart valves.&nbsp;</p>

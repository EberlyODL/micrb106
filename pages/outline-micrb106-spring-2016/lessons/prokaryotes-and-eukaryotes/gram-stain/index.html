<p>Though the cell wall structure of a cell cannot be seen with a light microscope, it can be shown to be either gram positive or gram negative by a simple differential staining technique. We call it a differential stain because it allows us to see the difference between two options. The stain process takes advantage of the different thickness of the pepdioglycan layers. Gram positive cells with a thick layer will trap dye more effectively than a gram negative cell. Thus it is possible to tell them apart. The Gram stain process is shown below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, the gram positive cell retains the crystal violet stain and is purple while the gram negative cell would be clear of stain after rinsing with the alcohol. The pink color comes from adding Saffranin, just to make it show up under magnification. With the gram stain, you can get quite a bit of information. First you know if it&#39;s a gram positive or gram negative bacterium. Either result eliminates about half of all the possibilities. Then you can see the cell shape, that eliminates about half of what possibilities remain. Finally you can see if the cells are in a special arrangment. Now you can narrow down the possible field&nbsp;to a few dozen options. While it is impossible to tell what the exact bacterial species is just from a gram stain, you can eliminate most possiblilities in one glance.&nbsp;</p>

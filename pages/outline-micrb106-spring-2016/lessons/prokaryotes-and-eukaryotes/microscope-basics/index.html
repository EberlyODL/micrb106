<p>Bacteria are really small, but how small are they exactly? The illustration shows what objects can bee seen with the naked eye, like insects or mold. A microscope is needed to see red blood cells and bacteria. Anything smaller than that requires special microcopes called electron microscopes that use electron beam rather than beams of light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the scale in use here, micrometers and nanometers, do you realize how small this really is?&nbsp;A meter is about as long as a yardstick. A millimeter is one thousand times smaller. Hold your arms out as far apart as possible. That&#39;s about a meter. Now try to get two fingers as close together as you can without actually touching. That&#39;s about a millimeter. The difference between the two is 1000 times. Now a micrometer is 1000 times smaller than a millimeter. The image above shows the size of things in micrometers (or microns). That&#39;s how small things are that we see in a microscope, a few microns big.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most basic microscope is the light microscope.&nbsp;To magnify an image, one needs a magnifier or a lens, a piece of glass which makes everything appear larger. But there is a limit to how far a simple magnifier can make things bigger; that is about 8-10-fold. Lenses must be added, one behind another, (compounded) to increase this magnification. Then one can magnify the image up to 2000 times. The classic compound microscope magnifies in two steps: first with an objective lens (4x to 100x) which produces an enlarged image of the object. This is then magnified by the ocular lens or eyepiece. If a 100x objective is used it gets magnified by a 10x eyepiece and the final image will be 1000 times larger.</p>

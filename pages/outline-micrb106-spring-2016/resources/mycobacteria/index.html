<p>Mycobacteria includes two clinically significant disease causing organisms, one causes Tuberculosis and the other causes Leprosy. This group of bacteria have a unique cell wall structure containing high lipid content. They are differentiated from other bacteria by the Acid Fast stain, a differential staining technique used to identify them. The lipids in the cell wall make them difficult to stain so a special stain procedure is used. These organisms are also characterized by very slow growth. Generation times for Mycobacteria are 5, 10 or even 12 hours compared to 5 or 10 minutes for other bacteria. Due to this, culturing of these may take weeks, making rapid identification a problem.</p>

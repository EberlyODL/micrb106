<p>Once the early microbiologists were able to identify which microbes were responsible for different diseases, there was an interest in figuring out how to cure these diseases. The first step is knowing the enemy, the next step if figuring out how to get rid of them. Vaccination is one way of preventing disease and Pasteur and others did develop a few functional vaccines. However, this method only prevents onset of disease in someone who is treated to a vaccine. What about those who already have the disease? </p>

This was the idea behind Ehrlic's magic bullet, a drug that kills bacteria but not people. One such person who was working on this problem was<strong> Alexander Fleming</strong>. He was a Scottish doctor that worked in the Army Medical Corps during WWI. If ever there was a war more ideally suited to huge numbers of massive infections, Dr. Fleming never heard of it. The best they could do at the time for infections was to pour antiseptics on the wound and  hope for the best. Fleming's research concluded that this caused more harm that good as the antiseptics wound up depressing normal immune system activity. In essese they were making matters worse!</p>
<p>After the war he did research on the enzyme <strong>Lysozyme</strong>, naturally found in tears and saliva which has antibacterial properties. Thi was a great discovery but the enzyme was not suitable to mass production or injection into patients. Still, he kept trying. A notoriously messy lab researcher, he came back from vacation one day expecting to keep working on some plates of bacteria he had stored on the corner table only to find his experiments ruined. Some sort of green mold had begun growing on the plates, ruining them. Just before tossing them in the garbage he noticed that the bacteria he had placed all over the plates did not seem to be growing next to the mold. This was a pattern he recognized from his work on Lysozyme. Could the mold be producing a similar enzyme?</p>
<p>Turns out the mold was common Penicillium and it did indeed produce a compound that killed bacteria but was completely harmless to humans. One of the greatest discoveries of modern medicine was pure accident and nearly discarded. The compound was isolated and mass produced just in time for WWII where it saved untold numbers of lives.</p>
<p>An intersting aside, the British government was not able to fully fund his research at the outbreak of the war but the Americans were willing to do so. In a scene from an old spy movie, he and a colleague managed to smuggle the mold out of Britain to the United States by sprinking the spores throughout their clothes in case they were capured. One in the US they isolated the spores, grew it on petri dishes and were able to mass produce the Penicillin. </p>

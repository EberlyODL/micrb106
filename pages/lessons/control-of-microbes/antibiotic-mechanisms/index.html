<p>The basis for selective toxicity of an antibiotic rests on the ability of the drug to attack or interfere with a structure found in bacterial cells that our cells do not have. There are 5 mechanisms by which an antibiotic can attack a bacterial cell:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Inhibition of cell wall synthesis</li>
	<li>Inhibition of cell membrane function</li>
	<li>Inhibition of protein synthesis</li>
	<li>Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis</li>
	<li>Inhibition of bacterial enzymes / metabolic pathways</li>
</ol>

<h3>Antibiotics Active at the Cell Wall</h3>
<p><strong>Penicillin</strong> and its derivatives (ampicillin, amoxicillin) interfere with the ability of bacteria to build peptidoglycan. This weakens the cell wall, making gram positive cells susceptible to lysis in hypotonic environments. It tends to work best on growing cells that are building new cell wall components. Since our cells do not contain peptidoglycan, penicillin is relatively non toxic to our cells. Allergic reactions are always a possibility but not everyone experiences such complications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cephalosporins</strong> are considered the next generation of penicillin derivatives. This group has good activity against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. The newest ones are used against MRSA (methicillin resistant Staph aureus) infections, a particularly nasty illness. &nbsp;This is a good option for anyone allergic to penicillin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other drugs in this category include <strong>Bacitracin</strong>, a particularly effective antibiotic that is toxic to the kidneys. It is used topically for cuts and skin abrasions and is a main component of Neosporin antibiotic cream. <strong>Isoniazid</strong> is used to treat tuberculosis. <strong>Vancomycin</strong> is another commonly used antibiotic in this category which is often used for those allergic to Penicillin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main drug active on the cell membrane are the <strong>Polymyxins</strong>. They have a mode of action similar to a detergent which integrates within and disrupts the outer membrane of gram negative bacteria. The cells become sensitive to osmotic pressure as the membranes lose integrity. The cell can no longer control what goes in or out. This category of antibiotics is unique in that it is bacteriocidal, it can kill bacteria even if they are not actively growing. Due to toxicity in the kidney, this antibiotic is only used as a last resort for drug resistant strains or serious infections like a bad urinary tract infection.&nbsp;</p>

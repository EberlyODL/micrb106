<p>Heat has two different effects on living organisms. The use of dry heat at high temperatures will oxidize (burn) organic matter to ash. That&#39;s an effective method but it also tends to destroy the material being sterilized. Metal or glass can be effectively treated this way but most material is not capable of taking this type of heat. High temperatures are needed for this to work.</p>
<p>Moist heat like steam, is also effective but in a different way. Moist heat will affect the function of proteins. It will cause them to lose shape or&nbsp;<strong>Denature</strong>. Since cells need enzymes to carry on metabolism this will effectively destroy the cell but will not utterly destroy it like dry heat would.&nbsp;<strong>Pasteurization</strong>&nbsp;is a heating method used to destroy most (not all) vegetative cells without changing the basic structure of a fluid. It gets rid of most organisms without ruining the flavor of milk. However such things can still spoil if not treated properly. (Guys, milk doesn&#39;t last forever just because it&#39;s in the fridge.)</p>
<p>Disinfection&nbsp;can be acheived when fluids are boiled for 10 minutes. If the water supply becomes contaminated a boil water alert is given so customers will disinfect water before consuming it. True&nbsp;sterilization&nbsp;requires heating water up to 121 degrees C for 30 minutes. If water boils at 100 C, how is it possible to heat it more than that? Isn&#39;t boiling water as hot as it gets? Actually it&#39;s possible to make water even hotter by making steam under pressure. An&nbsp;<strong>Autoclave</strong>&nbsp;is a large pressure cooker that&#39;s used to heat materials up to 121 C for long periods of time. Usually 30 minutes is long enough to destroy all endospores.</p>

<p>Once the door is sealed, steam is pumped into the chamber under pressure and it&#39;s possible to get temperatures higher than boiling temperature. This steam will penetrate liquids to sterilize them. Of course the material has to be able to handle such high pressures. Media, instruments and even cloth can be sterilized in this way. Plastics tend to melt at this temperature though.</p>

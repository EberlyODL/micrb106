<p>Since bacteria are a couple microns big or so, it&#39;s possible to pass a liquid through a filter that does not allow the cells to pass through. Filtration is used to remove microbes from liquids that cannot tolerate being heated in an autoclave. Some media may contain vitamins or antibiotics that would be destroyed in an autoclave. However, nutrients are far smaller than a entire cells so these will pass through the pores in a membrane that will not allow a large cell to pass through.</p>

<p>This image shows a filtration setup. A sterile container has a filter at the top with a reservoir to hold the fluid to be filtered. A vacuum pump creates a vacuum in the sterile bottom container and this draws the fluid down into the bottom through the filter. All of the bacteria in the fluid will be trapped in the filter and the sterile fluid will pass through.</p>
<p>Of course, viruses may be small enough to pass through but filters are available that will remove even these tiny organisms.</p>

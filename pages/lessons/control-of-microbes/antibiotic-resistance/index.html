<p>An issue of major concern to modern medicine is the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria as these drugs are widely used and misused. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is not new, after all some bacteria <em>produce</em> antibiotics and it would be unfortunate to die from your own antibiotic! Resistance is based on any number of characteristics but where do these come from? Mutations are the source of bacteria developing methods to circumvent the actions of antibiotics. These mutations happen all the time when cells undergo cell division or are exposed to mutagens. These sorts of mutation are home grown so to speak, they appear on the host cell chromosome.</p>
<p>However, cells can acquire whole new sets of genes from other sources and overnight become resistant to a number of antibiotics at once. Bacteria can undergo transformation, transduction or conjugation. They can acquire plasmids that may contain multiple antibiotic resistance genes. These days antibiotic sensitivity testing is routine. Called the Kirby Bauer test it measures the effectiveness of different antibiotics so physicians can determine the most effective drug.</p>

<p>The more we use antibiotics the more these traits spread in a population. When we take an antibiotic it will naturally kill all of the bacteria that are susceptible to it. Consider, if you take an antibiotic and kill all the disease causing cells but the very last one, which one is that exactly? The one most resistant to that particular antibiotic. If it remains alive, it will start to reproduce and create an entire population of equally resisitant cells. This is why it's so crucial to finish a full prescription of antibiotics. Stopping halfway once you feel better only allows the strongest ones to survive. If that infection comes back, the last antibiotic you had will now be ineffective so the doctor will have to try another one.</p>
<p>This is why we have so many resistant strains today. It was due to decades of people not taking the drugs properly. Even worse are cases where doctors proscribe antibiotics when they are not needed. Too many parents want some pill to give their sick kids so they'll get better faster and stop being such a pain. They don't care that the child has a viral infection for which an antibiotic is useless. They just want "medicine" to make a sick child better. Over the years too many physicians caved in to such pressure.</p>

We are engaged in a form of biological warfare with infectious diseases as we race to create new drugs and then watch as strains develop  that makes the drug useless. Then we create a new one and the process repeats. Scientists worry that once these strains develop faster than we can respond, an organism may emerge what we cannot treat. We'll be set back 500 years, forced to watch patients die in the most comfortable manner we can arrange from a common bacterial infection. Even worse would be one that spreads easily and we can't control very well. We're one mutation away from the Dark Ages, a pandemic plague.</p>

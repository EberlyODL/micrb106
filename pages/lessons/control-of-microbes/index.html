<p>Once it was determined that microorganisms exist and they are capable of causing disease, the medical community scrambled to devise ways to control the presence and growth of these organisms. Beginning with routine hand washing to sanitation to aseptic surgical techniques, the science of microbial control dominates our lives. We have all sorts of odd ideas about what is free of microbes and what is not.</p>

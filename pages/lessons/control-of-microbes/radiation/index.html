<p>There are two kinds of radiation used to control microbial growth. Ionizing radiation is the kind of radiation you think about when someone mentions Chernobyl or Three Mile Island or the place where Homer Simpson works. This radiation causes breakages in DNA. The other type of radiation used is light radiation or Non-ionizing radiation. UV light is a common example.</p>
<p><strong>Ionizing Radiation</strong>&nbsp;is very damaging to living things. It&#39;s the kind of thing that kills when nuclear bombs are used or when nuclear powerplants melt down. No one wants to have radioactive material dumped nearby. This radiation physically breaks down DNA, obviously causing serious mutation. It is least effective on spores (which don&#39;t divide like living cells) but it&#39;s more effective on viruses though not much for the same reason. This type of radiation is most useful on living bacterial cells. Many common items are sterilized in this way: spices, pharmaceutical drugs and even some meat products like hamburger.</p>

<p>Though effective, this has not been widely used as a means of preventing food poisoning. Frankly people are too scared to allow it. The problem is not making the meat radioactive. After all it&#39;s like saying a person has become radioactive because they&#39;ve had an X ray... Still sometimes there are midly toxic chemicals formed in certain materials.</p>
<p><strong>Non-ionizing Radiatio</strong>n&nbsp;also damages DNA. UV light causes thymine dimer formation in DNA which can lead to frameshift mutations. It also causes the formation of free radicals that react with and damage cells. The problem here is that UV light does not penetrate past the surface. It&#39;s good for treating a lab bench surface but it won&#39;t penetrate to the center of a hamburger. UV light has been used to help sanitize air flow and water. Lowes and Home Depot sell a UV device that attached to household pipes that help "clean" the water in your house.</p>

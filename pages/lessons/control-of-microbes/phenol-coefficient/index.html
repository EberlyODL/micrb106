<p>There are a wide varitey of products available: soaps, detergents, bleach, lysol, ect. So how to know which is more effective than another? When comparing the effectiveness of a cleaning agent we use a measurement called the Phenol Coefficient. A consistent reference is needed so that when a new agent is produced we can describe it as being more or less effective than a known standard. For many years the gold standard that was used is the chemical Phenol. Lister used this as a spray during surgery and began the practice of asepsis in medicine. All chemicals used afterward were compared to this first standard.</p>

<p>The test uses particular strains of Salmonella typhi and Staphylococcus aureus in broth culture. These organisms are grown under standardized conditions and a set concentration of the chemical is tested against a set concentration of phenol. Phenol has a value of 1 and other chemicals will earn a lower number (0.8) if it's not as effective as phenol or a higher number (1.9) if it's more effective.</p>
<p>The specific mechanism of action either deals with the cell membrane or cellular protein function. Some agents like alcohols and soap will disrupt the cell membrane of microbes. Other agents will inhibit or destroy (denature) proteins. Sometimes the effect is the permanent destruction of these structure in which case we'd call it <strong>Bacteriocidal</strong> or the effect is temporary. A <strong>Bacteriostatic</strong> agent will slow or stop growth but if the agent is removed growth may resume. </p>

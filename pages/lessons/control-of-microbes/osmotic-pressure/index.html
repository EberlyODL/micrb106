<p>We have already discussed the effects on cells of a Hypertonic environment. Cells will lose water and become dehydrated. In olden times before refridgeration it was common practice to salt beef and pork in barrels to preserve it. Smoked meat involved both dehydration and the addition of different chemical residues that inhibit growth.</p>
<p>A method of preserving fruits and berries also takes advantage of creating a hypertonic environment. Just as salt can make a hypertonic solution, sugar can also create such an environment. Fruit preserves prevent spoilage by microbes throught the addition of so much sugar to the mix that it essentially creates a hypertonic environment. Microbes cannot tolerate this and will not grow. The irony is that such a rich carbohydrate source would otherwise be a perfect growing environment.</p>

<h3>Soaps and Detergents</h3>
<p>Most soap are mildly alkaline so there is a partial pH effect at work. Mostly however, it&#39;s a matter of the soap molecules dissolving the membrane of cells. They disrupt membrane structure and destroy the cell. These days additional compounds (triclosan) are added to make hand soap into anti-bacterial soap, which is sort of redundant. It&#39;s like calling it microbe killing anti-bacterial soap. The FDA has recently considered removing triclosan from all products on the market including deodorants, toothpaste and mouthwash due to concerns over bacteria becoming resisitant. There are also some allergy related concerns.</p>
<p>Ever notice how most public restrooms have soap dispensers? It&#39;s not to prevent a rash of soap theft, dispensers are used for hygenic purposes. Studies have been conducted where bars of soap from various public restrooms were studied. In some cases over 100 strains of bacteria were isolated from a single bar of soap. Microbes can actually survive on a bar of soap so they are not used in public restrooms very often.</p>
<p>Detergents work in a similar manner and are sometimes referred to as Quarternary Ammonium Compounds. These both clean and disinfect but become less effective in the presence of organic material.</p>
<h3>Halogens</h3>
<p>Halogens are a category of chemicals found on the periodic table. These are widely used but some can be pretty harsh. Chlorine is very effective but toxic. It is the active ingredient in bleach. Iodine is used as an antiseptic on the skin. Bromine is used in a similar way as Chlorine but it&#39;s often used in places where the harsh smell of chloring is inappropriate. Where chlorine is used in pools, bromine is often used in hot tubs inside the house.</p>
<h3>Heavy Metals</h3>
<p>Heavy metals are also commonly used. Silver or gold is used in teeth fillings because they are not degradable. A solution of silver nitrate was once used to flush the eyes of newborns to prevent infection by microbes present in the birth canal. Later an antibiotic cream was used but recently due to the rise of antibiotic resistance, the old silver nitrate solution has become popular again.</p>
<p>Mercury is used as a topical antiseptic as Mertiolate (the red stuff you mom used). Selenium is a common ingredient in dandruff shampoo to kill fungi. Even the copper sulfate found in water pipes in homes works to prevent algae growth.</p>
<h3>Alcohols</h3>
<p>Alcohol works to solubilize the membrane of cells. It also can denature proteins. While it may seem that the more concentrated the better, in the case of alcohol, a 70% solution has been found to be more effective than 95% solution.</p>
<h3>Phenols</h3>
<p>Phenol compounds and all derivatives will solubilize the membrane of cells. It also can denature proteins. Lysol is a common example of a phenol based cleaner. One benefit to this category is that unlike some others, the disinfection action of phenols will persist for hours or days. Another example is the use of Creosote to prevent the rotting of wood. Railroad beams and telephone poles often have a dark brown or black tar-like substance on them that prevents bacterial growth and decomposition.</p>
<h3>Oxidizing Agents</h3>
<p>Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) is a toxic substance to cells. Oxygen can be very damaging when found in certain forms. Strong oxidation will easily destroy a bacterial cell as long as any tissue nearby. It is especially effective against anaerobes that may be found in soil samples. At some point it&#39;s likely that you mom put the peroxide on a bad scrape or cut and you got to watch it bubble while screaming in pain.</p>
<h3>Aldehydes</h3>
<p>Examples in this category include Formaldehyde or Glutaraldehyde. These rapidly inactivate all enzymes in a cell. Proteins simply cease to function. This works very well on any organism that is resisitant to chemical control methods. However these chemicals are quite toxic and are known carcinogens, thus make poor antiseptics. These chemicals are used in the manufacture of carpeting and particle board used in construction. Sometimes these fumes are slowly released for years into a home.</p>
<h3>Gaseous compounds</h3>
<p>The main gaseous compound used today is Ethylene Oxide. This is the only chemical that can be called a <strong>sterilant</strong> in the entire list. Treatment with this gas will sterilize plactics or drugs. No other chemical discussed can be considered good enough to sterilize, they all disinfect. (some better than others) However, ethylene oxide is extremely toxic. It&#39;s used in a special chamber much like an autoclave but it just holds the gas, there is no heat involved. Ventilation is quite important before the door can be opened. This method of sterilization is commonly used on spices, pharmaceutical drugs, surgical supplies and plasticware. The plates and pipettes we use in lab are sterilized in this manner.</p>

<p>Americans use a wide variety of chemicals on an everyday basis for the purpose of making everything around us very clean. Mom never wanted us to have dirty clothes (meaning worn once), dirty dishes, or dirty rooms. One could argue that we live in an annoyingly sterile environment. Yet, reducing exposure to microbes, particularly pathogens has extended the lifespan of humans decades beyond what was typical even a few hundred years ago. Americans especially have a fascination with the killing of "99.9% of germs" all around us. Just walk down that aisle found in any grocery store to see the dozens and dozens of products specifically designed and marketed to making our lives clean.</p>
<p>Of course it's important to select an agent that has a good phenol coefficient if you want something that will effectively clean your bathroom. However, microbe killing power is not the only or even primary concern. What good is a chemical that's effective at inhibiting growth if it has to stay on the surface for 3 hours, stains your bathtub, requires a breathing mask, smells like rotton eggs and is $25 a bottle?</p>
<p>Many other factors come into play before a new cleaning agent is put on the market. First of all, the agent has to work relatively quickly. Bacteria are not destroyed instantly when a chemical agent is used, it take a bit of time. Fast acting agents are better than slow acting ones. The following chart shows the effectiveness of various chemical agents over time, and the percentage of bacteria destroyed.</p>

<p>You'll notice that soap and water does not seem to be very effective at all. A mixture of alcohol and acetone works a good bit faster, yet 70% ethanol is faster yet. The best result is tincture of iodine (the brown stuff) that your mother may have used on cuts when you were young. (The "red stuff" was tincture of mercury or mertiolate)</p>
<p>In addition to being good at killing organisms and working quickly there are many other relevant factors. It would be helpful if the agent was not toxic to work with. Formaldehyde is excellent at destroying microbes. Nothing can live in such a solution so it was commonly used to preserve biology specimens in science class. The old pickled pig fetus in a jar you may have seen. However, Formaldehyde is a carcinogen hence it can't be sprayed around the kitchen. Sometimes the agents are not water soluble so solvents like acetone or benzene are needed but these aren't particularly safe either.</p>
<p>Good agents should clean a surface but not leave a discolored mess behind. They should be able to be stored for long periods of time without degrading. After all how long does it take to use a whole bottle of Mr. Clean? It can't become useless in 3 weeks. Of course our society would not accept a really good, effective, safe agent that cost more than a few dollars. No one wants to spend $100 to clean the house one time.</p>
<p>Lastly, the chemical agent should have a pleasant smell. This may seem like the silliest of all the concernes raised so far but, this is the one companies are most concerned about from a marketing standpoint. Take a walk down the cleaning aisle in the store someday. Notice how every single product is trying to get your attention with the best smell. Pine fresh this, mountiain spring that, the list goes on and on just about the smell. As with many things in the marketing world, they try to sell you something you don't need. They would rather that you have a clean SMELLING house than an actual clean house. (Tip for guys: don't actually clean before your parents come to visit, spray a bit of lysol around the house and your mom will assume you cleaned because it smells like it was cleaned. This seems bizarre but it's how mom was trained. This works on significant others as well as long as they don't look in the fridge!) </p>

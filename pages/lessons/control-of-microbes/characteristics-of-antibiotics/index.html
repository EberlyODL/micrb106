<p>The fundamental principle of chemotherapy is <strong>selective toxicity</strong>. Any compound used to treat an infectious disease must be harmful to the parasites but not to host cells. This is in essence the principle of Paul Ehrlich&#39;s "magic bullet". Selective toxicity distinguishes an antibiotic which only attacks bacteria, from disinfectants and antiseptics which harm both bacteria and host cells. Gargling with bleach will certainly clear up your Strep throat but it will horribly burn all the tissue as well. Chemical agents like disinfectants and antiseptics are only used to inactivate microbes on inanimate surfaces or on the skin. They cannot be used internally, we need something different for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately antimicrobial agents are readily available in the world of the microbes. These organisms are essentially engaged in a form of chemical warfare with each other. If one organism can kill off all its neighbors it gains a competitive advantage for survival. Soil organisms in particular produce a variety of bacteria killing compounds. Many spore forming bacteria including members of the <strong>Bacillus</strong> and <strong>Streptymyces</strong> groups produce antibiotics as do spore forming fungi like <strong>Penicillium</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Antibiotics have two different effects on the growth and viability of bacteria. Some antibiotics exhibit <strong>Bacteriostatic</strong>&nbsp;effects in that they slow the growth of bacteria or prevent their multiplication. This type is not an outright cure, that relies on an active immune response to actually destroy the invading microbes. Because of this some infections become difficult to treat on patients that have weakened immune system like AIDS patients or anyone who is immunocompromised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other effect of some antibiotics is <strong>Bacteriocidal</strong>. These types of drugs are able to kill the microbes directly and do not rely on followup immune system responses. One major drawback of this type is they only work on metabolically active organisms. Some slow growing microbes like Mycobacteria (Tuberculosis and Leprosy) are not effectively treated with this category of antibiotic.</p>

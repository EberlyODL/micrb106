<p>Cells have enzymes that are capable of finding and repairing incorrect base pairing to prevent mutation. One common mutations comes when UV light causes thymine dimer formation. The repair mechanism, called <strong>excision repair</strong>, involves a set of enzymes that, ironically, require light to function. One enzyme complex locates and removes the offending dimer while another set of enzymes insterts the correct nucleotides. </p>

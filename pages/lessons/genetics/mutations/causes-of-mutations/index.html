<p>When a change in the letter sequence of DNA or RNA occurs, it is called a <strong>mutation</strong>. There are many chemical and physical causes of mutation. Many naturally occurring and man-made chemicals can cause mutations. Radiation of various kinds can cause mutation. Whatever the cause, changes in the nucleotide sequence can dramatically impact the coding of a protein.</p>
<p>During DNA Replication and Transcription, polymerase enzymes are charged with placing the proper nucleotides in the new strands. Sometimes these enzymes make mistakes. These spontaneous mutations happen all the time even though they are considered rare. One base out of 100,000,000 on average, will be wrong due to a mistake by a polymerase. Given the amount of bases that are replicated every day, errors are bound to happen eventually. Changes made during DNA replication are generally more damaging as they result in a permanent change. When RNA polymerase makes errors during transcription, it will cause problems with that particular mRNA but once discarded, the next mRNA manufactured will work just fine.</p>
<p>Ionizing and non ionizing radiation both cause DNA damage. Repair mechanisms can undo some of this type of damage but if exposed to too much too fast, it can easily lead to cell death. Later we'll discuss how we make use of radiation to kill harmful microbes. Different chemicals can also cause mutations in DNA and RNA. Carcinogens are the worst offenders as they cause mutations leading to cancer.</p>
<p>Mutations can happen by changes to a specific nucleotide in the sequence. These are <strong>Point Mutations</strong> as there is only an error with one base. However, since the mRNA code is read in sets of three (codon), any time a base letter is lost or gained it messed up the whole sequence from that point on. These <strong>Frameshift Mutations</strong> can be very serious. The table below summarizes the types of mutations. Each will next be discussed in detail.  </p>

<p>This is a simple test that can be performed to test for the mutagenic property of a chemical using bacteria as a test organism. The test detects if a chemical can mutate DNA. But how can that be seen? Too much of any chemical can be lethal, bleach is lethal, but it doesn't mutate DNA. The trick is to look for a change in the phenotype of an organism. The Ames Test looks for the ability of an organism to produce something it normally won't produce unless it's DNA has been mutated.</p>
<p>The test uses a strain of Salmonella that cannot produce <b><font color="#ff0000">Histidine</font></b>, a required nutrient. Such strains are called His- (histidine negative). The gene for His production has a point mutation, in other words, the gene is busted. If these bacteria are exposed to a mutagen it will randomly change things. It may randomly change the broken His gene back into its normal state. Of course this will sometimes happen spontaneously due to normal mutation that always occurs. </p>

<p>In this experiment, two plates are made. One plate includes the chemical being tested for mutagenicity, the other control plate contains no chemical. Both plates contain a small amount of the required histidine. This allows all the organisms to begin dividing and allows the mutagen (if it's really a mutagen) to have its effect. Eventually the Histidine will run out and only those that mutate will be able to produce more and survive.</p>
<p>The plate on the right mutated the DNA of the bacteria to the point where they produced their own histidine. Many mutated colonies are visible. The plate on the right, with no chemical, also produced a couple of mutated colonies. Random mutation make two mutants, the chemical on the other plate produced many mutated colonies. Thus the chemical is a mutagen. (don't eat it)</p>
<p>Just because a chemical is found to cause mutation does not mean it's carcinogenic (can cause a tumor). Since chemicals change inside an organism it's not possible to conclude it will cause tumors but it's certainly not a good sign. There is a 90% correlation between mutagens and carcinogens. A positive test helps determine if it's worth doing further animal testing.</p>

<p>Before discussing the process of Translation, there are a few more parts to the assembly process that need to be discussed. A <strong>ribosome</strong> is the assembly factory for proteins. Here the mRNA is translated and amino acids are physically connected to each other to form a protein.</p>

<p>A ribosome is like a pair of shells that fit on top of each other. There is a top subunit and a bottom subunit that fit together onto an mRNA strand. In addition the ribosome has two holes drilled into the top if it. One is called the A site and the other is the P site. There are the locations where amino acids will be placed in order to hook them together into a chain.</p>
<p>Another important assembly component is the <strong>tRNA</strong> or <strong>transfer RNA</strong>. This is a single strand of RNA that forms a particular cloverleaf type shape. On one end is a set of 3 nucleotides called the <strong>Anticodon</strong>. This set of three will base pair to a specific codon on the mRNA. At the other end of the tRNA is attached a specific amino acid.</p>

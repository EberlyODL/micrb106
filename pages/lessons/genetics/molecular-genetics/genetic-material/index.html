<p>The genetic information in living organisms is contained in nucleic acids. The most common is DNA although some viruses may use RNA. The information contained in the DNA allows the cell to control it's internal metabolism and chemistry. A <strong>chromosome</strong> is an organized piece of DNA that contains such information. Chromosomes are large structures found within cells that carry genetic instructions.</p>
<p>Genetic information is stored inside living organisms in different ways. In eukaryotic cells there are many linear chromosomes stored in the nucleus. Some fungi and protozoa may have plasmids. Plant cells have some genetic information in the chloroplasts while mitochondria in animal cells also contain genetic information. Prokaryotic cells typically have a single circular chromosome and may also have plasmids. Viruses may contain DNA or even RNA as the basic genetic material. All of these cells contain genetic instructions.</p>

<p>The genetic instructions are called <strong>Genes</strong>, and these direct organismal development and function. A gene is a genetic unit of heredity that contains information needed to make a specific protein. These proteins often act as enzymes that carry out a specific bit of chemistry. The collection of genes found in a given organism is called the <strong>Genome</strong>.</p>
<p>Other terms to remember include <strong>Phenotype</strong> which is the physical appearance of a characteristic. There is a gene for eye color and one particular phenotype would be blue eyes. A different phenotype would be brown eyes. One particular bacterium may not be killed by Penicillin so it has an antibiotic resistant phenotype. <strong>Genotype</strong> is used to refer to the specific genetic makeup of the organism.</p>
<p>In humans, we have two genes for everything. Essentially we have a backup copy. But both copies don't have to be the same. One gene may code for blue eyes the other may code for brown. If brown is the dominat trait the phenotype will be brown eyes. But that individual could pass on the blue eyed trait to offspring and have blue eyed children. Bacteria don't follow this pattern as they only have a single circular chromosome.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Translation is the most complex of the three processes performed by all living cells. A single stranded mRNA is now ready for decoding. The string of letters contained in a mRNA, the A’s, U’s, C’s and G’s now have to be translated into specific instructions for hooking together a specific series of amino acids into a chain to form a protein.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The letters of the mRNA are read in sets of 3. Each set of 3 letters forms a <strong>Codon</strong> or a code that represents a specific amino acid. Read the codons along a mRNA and one can see exactly which amino acids get placed into sequence.</p>

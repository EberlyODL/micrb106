<p style="text-align: justify;">All living cells perform several basic functions. Two of these are reproduction and carrying out basic cellular functions. From a genetics perspective, all cells are able to reproduce by making an exact copy of all genes so that each new cell formed after division will have a full set of genes. <strong>DNA Replication</strong> is a fundamental process carried out by all living cells.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Beyond replicating the DNA, cells are able to process the information contained in a gene and build a protein. This is a two-step process. First, a copy of the desired gene is made in the process of <strong>Transcription</strong>. This copy is then decoded into the specific instructions for connecting amino acids together in a very specific order. The decoding step is called <strong>Translation</strong>.</p>

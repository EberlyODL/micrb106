<p>Eukaryotes have an additional step in the Transcription process that prokaryotes do not have. In a eukaryotic cell, Transcription takes place in the nucleus. Before the newly made mRNA leaves the nucleus, it undergoes post-transcriptional processing. Some of the bases in the unprocessed mRNA are not useful, they do not code for a final protein product. These regions of non coding letters are intervening sequences or <strong>Introns</strong>.</p>
<p>The portions of the mRNA that are needed are called <strong>Exons</strong> but they are broken up into smaller sequences by these useless introns that are in the way. The introns must first be removed. Special enzymes called Spliceosomes remove the introns and stitch the exons together to form a finished mRNA. This is now ready to be translated into the directions needed to build a specific protein. </p>

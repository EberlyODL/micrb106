<p>The genetic code then is made up of a series of 4 bases arranged into sets of 3 letters. That makes for 64 unique 3 letter combinations. However, there are only 20 commonly used amino acids used. There are then several codes that designate each amino acid. The following chart details all the codons and their corresponding amino acid.</p>

<p>Some of these codons are unique. The one in green is called the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><strong>start codon</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(AUG). Three other codons, the ones in red, are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><strong>stop codons</strong><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>(UAA, UAG, UGA). By finding the start and stop codons it’s possible to find the exact sequence of amino acids used to construct a specific protein.</p>

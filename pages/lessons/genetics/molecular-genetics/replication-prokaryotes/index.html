<p>DNA replication in prokaryotes presents some interesting complications. In bacteria, the chromosome is a round circle in appearance. Since there is no end to start from the DNA polymerase enzymes need a place to begin. This happens at the <strong>Origin of Replication site</strong> or <strong>Ori site</strong>. Here the double stranded DNA is separated and two primers are inserted. Two DNA polymerases then begin synthesizing new DNA strands in <em>opposite directions</em>. There are two replication forks that work to copy all of the DNA in the chromosome. </p>

<p>As the replication forks proceed around the circle, eventually they will meet at the far side of the chromosome. At this stage there will be two completed circular chromosomes. When the bacterial cells divides, each new cell will have its own chromosome. </p>

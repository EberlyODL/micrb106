<p>This is another method that allows genes to be transferred from one bacterial cell to another. In this case a virus accidentally transfers the genes. Just like there are viruses that infect animal cells, there are viruses that infect plant cells and also bacteria. A bacterial virus is called a <strong>Bacteriophage </strong>(or just Phage). Understanding this process requires a bit of background on how viruses work.</p>
<p>Viruses cannot replicate on their own. They infect a host cell and take over the replicating machinery of the cell to make baby viruses. Two things are produced, genetic information is duplicated and protein parts needed for the shell of the virus are manufactured. Once the viral DNA replication process is finished, the parts of the virus are assembled and the virus particles are released. They then go on to infect other cells.Â </p>
<p>Part of the process of viral infection may involve the destruction of the host chromosome. The host cell is sort of lobotomized so only the viral genes are in control. When it comes time to assemble the virus particle, the viral DNA has to be inserted.</p>
<p>Sometimes the chopped up host cell DNA is accidentally inserted instead of the viral DNA. Then when the virus infects another cell, it's not viral DNA that's introduced, it's the DNA from another, dead bacterial cell. Thus DNA is transferred from one bacterium to another. If recombination occurs then the new cell will have a new gene or set of genes. This process is called Generalized Transduction.</p>

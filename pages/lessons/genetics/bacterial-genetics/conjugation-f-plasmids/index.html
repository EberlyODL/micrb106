<p>This last process is the most complicated and probably the most specialized. Some bacteria contain extra bits of DNA found in circular form called <strong>Plasmids</strong>. Previously these have been described as containing different potentially useful genes like antibiotic resistance genes. They may also contain genes for degredative enzymes or genes that allow for special metabolism. They may also contain genes for certain pathogenic factors like the production of a capsule.</p>
<p>These plasmids have an ori site just like the bacterial chromosome which mean they get replicated each time the chromosome does before cell division. Once a cell acquires such a plasmid they and all the daughter cells will also contain the plasmid.</p>
<p>One type of plasmid is called the<strong> Fertility or F Plasmid</strong>. Cells that have this plasmid are called F+ cells. Those that lack it are called F- cells. The fertility plasmid contains genes that code for an ability to copy itself to another cell. It does this by first forming a pilus which connects to another bacterial cell forming a bridge between the two.</p>
<p>A copy is made of the plasmid which is passed through the tunnel to the F- cell. Since the plasmid is double stranded, one strand is passed through the tunnel where it serves as a template that is used to synthesize the other strand. The process it the same as DNA replication. Now the F- cell has it's own Fertility plasmid and it becomes an F+ cell.</p>

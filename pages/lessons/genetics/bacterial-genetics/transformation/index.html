<p>Bacteria are the ultimate scavengers. They live in environments that are often short of required nutrients. Bacteria have a need for nucleic acids so they have the ability to absorb naked DNA. Normally this DNA would be broken down and reused by the cell. Sometimes however, the bit of DNA gets incorporated into the bacterial chromosome.</p>
<p>The following shows a well known experiment by Dr. Griffith that demonstrated this property.</p>

<p>Two different bacterial strains were used. One had a capsule the other did not. Capsules make it difficult for the Immune system to fight off an infection. When a mouse is injected with the capsule forming organism, it dies as shown in box A. When injected with a strain lacking the capsule it lives as shown in box B. If the disease causing strain is heated and injected, the mouse is not harmed (shown in box C).</p>
<p>However, if the living, harmless strain is mixed with the dangerous but dead strain the combination will cause disease and kill the mouse (box D). How did this happen? Both of these strains were shown to be harmless when injected separately. What happened when both were cominbed to make them deadly? A look at the dead mouse shows what happened. Two living strains were recovered from the dead mouse. Both the capsule producing strain and the non capsule strain were found but only one (harmless) living strain was injected. How could this happen? Apparently the non capsule producing strain acquired the capsule gene from the dead cells and used it to start producing a capsule. This is an example of <strong>Transformation</strong>. </p>

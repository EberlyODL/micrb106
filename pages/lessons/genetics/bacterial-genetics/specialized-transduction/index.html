<p>Sometimes the life cycle of a phage involves an extra step that is different from the typical life cycle. In the lysogenic sequence of viral infection, the viral genes become incorporated into the host chromosome. This results in the formation of a prophage whereby the viral genes insert into a specific spot on the bacterial chromosome. When the virus re-enters the lytic cycle, it takes a bit of the chromosomal DNA with it. This leads to the transfer of bacterial genes as well as the viral genes to a new cell when the virus completes it's life cycle and leaves the host cell. This process is depicted below. </p>

<p>In this case the transduction process intentionally transfers bacterial genes from one cell to another. </p>

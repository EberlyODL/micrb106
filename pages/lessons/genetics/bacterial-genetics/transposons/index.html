<p>These <strong>transposable elements</strong> are genes that have the ability to move or hop around from one place to another within a chromosome. Sometimes they can jump from a chromosome to a plasmid. Then they would be able to be transferred to another cell as part of that plasmid. Somtimes the transposon replicates itself before it moves, other times it does not. </p>
<p>These genes can encode for a variety of features including antigenic characteristics, colony morphology or color and most importantly, antibiotic resistance. </p>

<p>Bacterial endospores are formed when cells find themselves in such extreme conditions that they are in peril of dying. In order to survive harsh conditions the cell prepares and endospore where it packs everything needed to survive until conditions improve. When a bacterial cell is thriving and life is good, it is called a vegetative cell. This is the normal condition most cells find themselves in.</p>
<p>However, bacteria like Bacillus and Clostridium have the ability to form a spore just before they die off, that will allow them to resume life or become a vegetative cell again if conditions improve. These bacteria are commonly found in the soil which is about as harsh an evnironment as there is. It could be too hot or too cold or just too dry to support a living cell. An endospore however, can live in the soil for decades waiting for the right conditions to allow the cell to be reborn and reproduce again. </p>
<p>Unlike mold spores where the idea is to reproduce, (so many, many spores are made) bacteria only produce a single endospore. It is a survival mechanism not a reproductive method. The process of <strong>sporulation</strong> is shown below. </p>

<p>The medical importance of bacterial endospores is significant. They are probably even more imporant to the food industry as the main feature of bacterial endospores is their extreme toughness. While is it typically pretty easy to kill off vegetative cells, no matter how scary a pathogen they may be, bacterial endospores are notoriously hard to destroy. They are resistant to heat, to chemicals, to radiation. In fact you can't say something is sterile until you can certify that it is free of endospores. </p>
<p>Endospores are the bane of the food industry. They are soil organisms so they'll be present on any vegetable and the skins of any animal. If you're canning something and you do not kill all the spores, they can enter a vegetative state inside the sealed can or jar and grow just fine without oxygen as in the case of anaerobic Clostridium. This is where Botulism comes from, a deadly type of food poisoning. Anthrax spores can exist in a field where an infected animal died and decomposed back when grandpa was a kid.</p>
<p>It is impossible to sterilize an acre of farmland so prevention has to happen in the processing factory. Sufficient heat will destroy endospores but it has to be high heat for a sufficient period of time. Boiling for a few minutes won't work. When people used to can food at home they used pressure cookers to create steam pressure and increase temperatures over 100°C for 10-20 minutes. </p>

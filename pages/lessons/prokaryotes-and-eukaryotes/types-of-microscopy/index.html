<h3>Brightfield Microscopy</h3>
<p>This is the simplest and most common type of microscopy done with a compound microscope.  A specimen is prepared on a microscope slide, placed on the stage and viewed under magnification.  Unstained cells do not offer much contrast so are very difficult to see.  Because of this, specimens are typically stained by the application of some type of dye to colorize them and provide contrast from the background.</p>
<h3>Darkfield Microscopy</h3>
<p>Dark field microscopy is a method which also creates contrast between the object and the surrounding field. As the name implies, the background is dark and the object is bright.   Some creative redirection of the light passing through the specimen gives the effect. Light coming from the outside of the beam passes through the object but it cannot be seen directly. Only when light is deflected and deviated by the object can it be seen. This method also produces a great deal of glare and therefore the specimen often appears as a bright silhouette rather than as a bright object of which much detail can be determined. This image shows brightfield and darkfield microscopy side by side.</p>

<h3>Phase Contrast Microscopy</h3>
<p>Phase contrast microscopy is a microscopic method which allows the viewing of unstained, living specimens by using the light phase amplitude differences within microscopic objects. When an unstained biological specimen is observed in the normal brightfield microscope, it is quite difficult to see because most biological material is uncolored and transparent. To overcome this problem without staining or otherwise treating the specimen, microscopists have used a trick to change the amplitude or brightness of the light passing through the specimen. This images shows a brightfield image on the left and the phase contrast image on the right.</p>

<p>If one looks at an unstained specimen, it is difficult to see. When a light wave passes through an object, it is deviated, that is, it becomes phase shifted or bent a bit. By bending the light slightly the specimen becomes darker or lighter relative to the background.  The end result is a change in the brightness of the specimen.  The background will appear darker than the specimen making it much easier to see, even if unstained. A big advantage to this method is the ability to view unstained specimens that are still living. </p>
<h3>Fluorescence Microscopy</h3>
<p>This type of microscopy uses specialized dyes that fluoresce under a laser. Special microscopes capture the image on a computer screen. The advantage to this type of microscopy is the ability to use dyes that stain specific parts of the cell.</p>

<h3>Confocal Microscopy</h3>
<p>Confocal is defined as "having the same focus." The microscope is able to remove the out-of-focus light from above and below the point of focus in the object. Normally when an object is imaged in the fluorescence microscope, the signal produced is from the full thickness of the specimen which does not allow most of it to be in focus to the observer. You really focus on one slice of the object but you still see parts above and below which are, by definition, out of focus just a bit.</p>
<p>The confocal microscope eliminates this out-of-focus information by means of a confocal "pinhole". Light from above and below the plane of focus of the object is eliminated from the final image. What you see is essentially just a thin slice of the thickness of the whole cell. By carefully focusing on different planes, it's possible to optically section a specimen much like slicing a load of bread. By focusing on each slice one can see the 3D relationships of interior structures. This method also uses similar dyes as fluorescent microscopy.</p>
<h3>Electron Microscopy</h3>
<p>As we've discussed, once something is magnified beyond a certain point, the resolution becomes so poor that the resulting image is too blurry to be of use. The only way to maintain high resolution at high magnification is to "look" at a specimen using something with different properties than mere light.</p>
<p>In this case a beam of electrons is used rather than simple light. This allows for a far better resolution which is needed when magnification reaches 100,000x or even one million times magnified. </p>

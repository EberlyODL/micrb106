<p>Beyond basic staining of cells just to improve contrast and visibility, there are a number of staining techniques that highlight specific cell structures. These fall into two categories, Differential stains and Structural stains.</p>
<h3>Differential Stains</h3>
<p>A differential stain is used to show differences between two otherwise similar looking cells. Such stains provide the ability to visually distinguish between a number of cells just by using a microscope. These stains react differently based on the chemical composition of the organism. Two of the most common are the Gram Stain and the Acid Fast stain.</p>
<p><b>Gram Stain</b></p>
<p>The gram stain distingishes between the two different types of bacteria found in nature. The cell wall structure of most bacteria consists of a plasma membrane and an additional layer of peptidoglycan. Two cell wall structures are possible. One consists of a thick layer of peptidoglycan while the other consists of a thin layer of peptidoglycan with a second phospholipid membrane. The gram stain procedure differentially stains one type dark while the other becomes colorless. In this way the two different types are clearly distinguishable under a microscope.</p>
<p><b>Acid Fast Stain</b></p>
<p>The cell wall of certain bacteria are unique in that they contain large amounts of glycolipids. The acid fast stain takes advantage of this because cells containing the glycolipids that are stained with carbol fuchsin will not lose the color when rinsed with acid alcohol. Certain medically important organisms can be identified by this technique including the organisms that cause tuberculosis and leprosy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Structural Stains</h3>
<p>A structural stain takes advantage of differences between a particular structure and the rest of the cell. It can selectively stain one part of the cell, making it visible. For example, bacterial capsules and endospores are resistant to staining. Since they are so hard to stain it&#39;s also true that they make it difficult to remove the stain once it&#39;s present.</p>
<p><strong>Spore stain</strong></p>
<p>Bacterial endospores are notoriously difficult to stain but once stained they do not lose the stain easily. It is however easy to remove the stain from the rest of the cell. If a second stain is used with a different color, it&#39;s possible to show both parts of the cell. The picture above shows some bacilli where the spore was stained red, but the red was rinsed away from the rest of the cell. Then a blue dye was added to color the rest of the cell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Capsule Stain</strong></p>
<p>The glycolax structure helps the cell attach to surfaces like your teeth or to medical catheters. It also protects the organism from attack by the Immune System. That&#39;s good for the organism and bad for you! The most pathogenic organisms often produce a good sized capsule.&nbsp;Bacterial capsules can be easily seen with structural stains. Another simple method to see them is a negative stain, shown below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Flagella Stain</b></p>
<p>Flagella are found on motile organisms or bacteria that can swim around. They are like little propellers that move a cell around in search of nutrients in a liquid environment. There are many patterns on cells for where the flagella are found. Sometimes they are all one end, other times they may be found on opposite ends. Sometimes they are spread out all over the surface of the cell. Another staining technique makes the flagella become visible under the microscope. The following image shows a flagella stain.&nbsp;</p>

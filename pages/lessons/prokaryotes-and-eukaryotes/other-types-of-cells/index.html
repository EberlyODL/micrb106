<p>Aside from prokaryotes there are two other major groups of cells. These are the Archea and of course, Eukaryotes. Features of these other cell types are discussed below. </p>
<h3>Archaea</h3>
<p>Once thought to be prokaryotes, these cells are have characteristics of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes though we now understand they are closer to eukaryotes than anything else. Archaea are the most primitive of all cell types and they most closely resemble the first cells found back in the time of the primordial soup of early earth. </p>
<p>Archaea today live in the most extreme environments and have some of the most unique metabolism of all living cells. Some perfer to live in very high temperature environments (<strong>hyperthermophilic</strong>). Others prefer very cold temperatures (<strong>psychrophilic</strong>). The <strong>methanogens</strong> convert CO2 and H2 into methane gas. Many archea can tolerate wide variations in pH and salt concentrations. Earlier we discussed how bacteria are ubiquitious, it is the archaea that make it so as they happily live in places where no other cells can survive. </p>
<h3>Eukaryotes: the Fungi</h3>
<p>Fungi make up a large and diverse groups of organisms. From single celled yeast to molds to large mushrooms, they encompass many different groups. <strong>Yeasts</strong> are round single celled organisms that split off or bud a new cell, similar to how bacteria reproduce. </p>

<p>Other fungi like the molds, form long filamentous cells called <strong>Hyphae</strong>. Sometimes these are divided into sections which then make them <strong>septate hyphae</strong>. Molds like penicillium are quite helpful to us but other molds can make us sick. Agriculture has many examples of molds that ruin crops. A significant amount of fruit becomes ruined before ever making it to stores because of mold. </p>

<p>Fungi are <strong>saprophytic </strong>which means they decompose plant and animal matter for food. They have enzymes that can break down just about any organic matter. They tend to thrive in moist environments in particular. Some fungi break off parts of their hyphae to reproduce while other form spores in huge numbers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Eukaryotes: the Protozoa</h3>
<p>These are single celled eukaryotes, larger than bacteria, which are found througout the environment in soil and water. They feed on dead plant and animal matter in a wide range of habitats. When active and moving around they are called a <strong>trophozoite</strong> but can enter a dormant stage when they are called a <strong>cyst</strong>. (this is similar to the bacterial endospore stage) A number of protozoa are pathogens including Giardia (water contaminant), Trichomonas (STD), Cryptosporidium (water contaminant) and Plasmodium (malaria). </p>

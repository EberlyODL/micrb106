<p>All living cells have certain features in common. They all are enclosed by a plasma membrane with cytoplasm held inside. They all contain nucleic acids, ribosomes and membrane transport mechanisms. Even though all of these things are in common between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, there are differences. Eukaryotes have their multiple chromosomes stored in a special structure called the nucleus. Prokayotes do not, the single chromosome floats around in the cytoplasm. Both cell types contain ribosomes yet the structure of each one is actually somewhat different. </p>
<p>There are other differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes in that each one has specific structures the other does not. Cell structures unique to eukaryotic cells were listed in the earlier cell biology lesson. Here we'll discuss some of the cell structures unique to prokaryotes. </p>
<p>The most basic thing to discuss about a bacterial cell is its shape. Bacteria come in all sorts of shapes. Round ones are called C<strong>occi</strong>. Then there are <strong>Bacilli</strong> which are rod shaped cells. A cell that is sort of round and not quite a rod (something like an oval) would be called a <strong>Coccobacillus</strong>. If a rod shaped cell has a bit of a curve to it, like a comma, it's called a <strong>Vibrio</strong>. Then there are cells with a corkscrew or even a spring shape which are referred to as a <strong>Spirillum</strong> or <strong>Spirochete</strong>. </p>
<p>Making things even more interesting, these cells often times cluster together into specific patterns that can be seen using a microscope. A pair of cocci are called <strong>Diplococci</strong>. Sometimes cocci will form chains, the <strong>Streptococci</strong> do this. Other times cocci may form clusters which is a characteristic of <strong>Staphylococci</strong>. </p>

<p>Bacilli may not form any particular pattern but when they do it often looks like a line of them linked together to form a chain. The cells depicted here seem to have white centers in some of them. These are endospores, we'll discuss them a bit later. </p>

<p>In the 1880&#39;s <strong>Hans Christian Gram</strong> was working in a morgue, interested in the cause of death of those around him and he spent time staining the lung tissues of those who died of disease. (Remember this was the golden era of microbiology when many disease causing organisms were being studied.) He experimented with various dyes trying to find a combination that allowed him to easily view the bacteria. Eventually he worked out a staining method that led to one of two possible results each time. This led to the discovery that bacteria have two distinct cell wall structure possibilities. These are still referred to as Gram negative or Gram positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It turns out that bacteria have two different types of cells wall structures. One involves a very thick layer of peptidoglycan, but the other has a very thin layer. In addition, the one with the thin layer of peptidoglycan has a second cell membrane. This second membrane contains <strong>lipopolysaccharide (LPS)</strong> molecules that play a role in disease. They form <strong>endotoxin</strong> which is released when the cell is destroyed. The role of endotoxin will be discusses later.</p>
<p>The structures of gram positive and gram negative cells are shown here:</p>

<p>As you can see, <strong>gram positive</strong> cells have a thick layer (purple) of peptidoglycan outside the cell membrane. The<strong> gram negative</strong> cells have a much thinner (pink) layer of peptidoglycan but this is reinforced with a second membrane on top of it. This was the structure that Hans Christian Gram discovered even though all he knew was one cell stained purple with his technique and the other was red when stained. Only later did scientists figure out what the structure of the cell wall really looked like.&nbsp;</p>

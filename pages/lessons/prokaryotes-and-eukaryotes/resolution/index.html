<p>Making things bigger isn't enough. The image has to be clear when magnified. If you take a small jpeg image on a computer and make it larger, the image becomes pixillated. The same thing can happen here so having good lenses will improve resolving power. The image below shows what a cell looks like with low resolution versus high resolution. </p>
<p align="left">Typically, a person would think that a microscope is an instrument designed to magnify small things. But, this really isn't the case. It is about making things larger yet clear enough to be useful. For example, you can go out to any hobby or toy store and for $49.95 buy an instrument capable of magnifying objects up to 1200 times. And that includes a zoom lens and light source. Most student and research microscopes magnify no more than 1000 times with a cost starting at around $1500, and research microscopes going into the tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p align="left">Is the academic community being taken for a ride? No. The $49.95 microscope only gives you an image that is a soft blur at 1000 times, whereas the research microscopes image is crystal sharp. This is called resolution, the ability to see fine details. Once you can resolve fine details then you can magnify them. </p>
<p align="left">This property of a lens is related to the <strong>Numerical Aperture</strong> which is correlated with resolution.  The higher the N.A. of a lens the better its resolving power and the brighter the image it can produce. <strong>Resolving power</strong> is defined as the ability of a lens to distinguish between small objects. Obviously, this differs greatly from magnification which is just the ability of the lens to enlarge the size of an object. It does not mean that you will necessarily be able to resolve details in the object. This picture shows the difference between good resolution and poor resolution when trying to magnify a cell.</p>

<p>At high magnification light itself starts to become a problem due to the fact that it bends when passing through all the lenses used on a microscope. Besides the quality of the lenses used in a microscope, there is another factor that can improve resolving power. The other method of improving resolution is the use of <b><font color="#ff0000">immersion oil</font></b> and special oil immersion objectives.  This special oil reduces the amount of light bending that occurs when light travels from one material into another.  As the light passes through the slide and specimen it is refracted.  As it leaves the glass of the slide and enters the air it bends again one more time as it passes into the objective. The end result of using oil is that more diffracted light is collected by the lens. The more light that is collected, the better the resolution will be.</p>

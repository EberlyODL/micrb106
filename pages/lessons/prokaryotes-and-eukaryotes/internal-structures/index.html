<p>Bacteria have internal structures that are similar to all living cells but are somewhat different from eukaryotes. The genetic material for bacteria consists of a <strong>single, circular chromosome</strong> rather than the multiple linear chromosomes found&nbsp;in eukaryotes like plant and animal cells.</p>
<p>Bacteria also have circular bits of DNA called <strong>plasmids</strong> that are not found in animal cells. These plasmids contain genes that are not necessary to the cell but may be quite handy just the same. Plasmids may contain genes for antibiotic resisitance, the production of unique enzymes or other proteins with characteristics that may contribute to the pathogenecity of the cell. The genes may code for some toxin for instance. Plasmids can be shared between cells to confer these abilities on other cells. This transfer is discussed in the genetics unit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like all cells, bacteria have ribosomes to manufacture proteins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ribosomes come in two pieces that fit together to form a complete structure. The large and small subunits form around a messenger RNA to decode the instructions locked in DNA for building a protein. It is of note that bacterial ribosomes are not the exact same size and composition as eukaryotic ribosomes. They are different enough that antibiotics can be used to disrupt the function of bacterial ribosomes yet leave your eukaryotic ribosomes alone and unharmed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Athletes today have developed a collection of pharmecuticals and other "natural" products to enhance the development of muscle mass. More and stronger muscles gives a performance edge to people who can early millions of dollars each year to basically play a game in front of others. It's good work if you can get it and the competition is severe. (Remember Lance Armstrong?)</p>
<p>Therefore a great deal of motivation exists to get better and stronger faster than the other guy. Thus athletes have long tried to take things like steroids to boost muscle mass. However there are severe health complications involved (not to mention an issue of fairness to those who just train really, really hard to get good), so most professional and amateur sports strongly discourage or have banned using such dangerous substances.</p>
<p>While some professional sports have in some ways not been too concerned with performance enhancing drugs the International Olympic Committee has been very harsh with anyone found to have taken banned materials. That enforcement is based on testing of body fluids for the presence of anything that looks suspicious. But what would they do if an athlete was able to produce more naturally ocurring hormones than another person? They couldn't be accused of doing anything unnatural, that's just the way someone was born after all--right? It would be like banning a player from playing basketball because they were <em>too</em> tall!</p>
<p>But what if an athlete was able to alter the genetic structure of their muscles? No drugs are needed so there is nothing to detect. What then?</p>
<h2>Gene Doping . . . A Better Athlete Without the "Roids"</h2>
<p>Gene doping is a term used to refer to the abuse of legitimate medical gene therapy treatments that modify a person's genetic makeup. The idea is to modify traits that would enhance sports performance. Muscle repair and growth are ultimately controlled by genes. Erythropoetin is a hormone that controls the production of red blood cells. The more blood cells, the more oxygen, which means muscle won't fatigue as easily. Growth factor hormones control the rate of muscle cell division.</p>

<p>One gene of interest in this area is a gene that controls the production of a hormone called Myostatin. Myostatin controls how big a muscle can get. One particular breed of bull has a genetic defect in this gene which allows it to produce very large muscles. This Belgian Blue Bull has a defect in the Myostatin gene and this is the end result.</p>

<p>This mutation can occur in humans. Sometimes a child is borne with the same defect. These super-muscular babies have abnormally large muscles in the legs. Since newborns cannot walk, let alone work out, such large muscle development is not normal.</p>

<p>So the question becomes, can the gene controlling muscle development in humans be altered in an adult? The answer is yes, eventually. Different genetics labs have been able to achieve this result in mice to produce so called "Schwarzenegger Mice." It's only a matter of time till this is done with humans.</p>
<p>Of course this type of terminology is also part of the problem with genetic alteration. It conjures up all sorts of images of giant Terminator-like mice running amuck.</p>
<p>So, given this information, should humans alter their genetic makeup for cosmetic reasons? Should athletes be permitted to built the perfect body, not in the gym but in the laboratory?</p>

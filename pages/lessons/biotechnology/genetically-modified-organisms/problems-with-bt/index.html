<p style="text-align: justify;">So if Bt is so safe why not put the gene into everything? There are two issues that come up with Bt corn, for example. One is the fact that Bt corn is not <strong>approved</strong> for consumption in humans by the FDA. One particular corn variety, StarLink, produced by Aventis Crop Sciences, contains a protein known as Cry9C. This protein is not easily digested so it could, possibly, be an allergen in humans, but this has not been tested. However, this particular corn variety is approved for use in animal feed so it's widely grown for that purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In 2003 a number of taco shells produced by Taco Bell were being sold in grocery stores. They tested positive for the Cry9C protein. Somehow corn being grown for cows found its way into a factory that made taco shells for consumers. This caused great controversy and the corn variety is no longer widely used.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Another possible issue with the use of Bt plants is the effect on other insects species that are not causing a problem. Insecticide is insecticide after all. It won't kill just the "bad" insects. Bt corn can produce the pesticide in its pollen. There are concerns that the pollen may interact with other plants and confer this insecticide gene to another, unintended plant species.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Of concern is the transfer of the Bt gene to milkweed. The monarch butterly feeds on milkweed and the concern is that this transfer of pesticide gene from corn to milkweed would inadvertently kill off the monarch butterfly population. Since everyone loves the monarch butterfly (think the Bambi of insects...) no one wants to risk using the Bt corn. New research suggests, however, that in the field, the impact on monarch butterfly populations has been negligible. Still it's an argument that is often put forth by opponents of genetically modified crops.</p>

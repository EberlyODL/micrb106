<p>Early examples of genetic transfer into plants centered on the insertion of a gene from a firefly. The luciferase gene allows an organism to "glow." This was an easily observable trait that was inserted into tobacco plants. The resulting transgenic plant was able to light up by itself, allowing scientists to see the success of the gene transfer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Many other plants have been engineered to contain genes from other plants or even other organisms altogether in order to create traits in a target organism that would not be possible with traditional selective breeding methods. Some goals of this technology are to increase the yield of crops so that more food can be grown using less space. Also, plants can be produced that grow in conditions where they&#39;d normally die out. Drought and frost resistant plants have been developed that are of particular use in countries where the climate makes it hard for many to grow enough food to survive.</p>
<p>Transgenic corn and soybean contain genes that make them resistant to herbicides or the insecticide, Bt toxin. The insecticide Bt has been long used to control the destuction of crops by insects. The European corn borer is an insect that&#39;s very destructive to corn plants. Now plants can produce their own insecticide without the need for a farmer to spray the field all the time. This image shows what happens to corn when it&#39;s attacked by insects or when it&#39;s grown with Bt toxin.</p>

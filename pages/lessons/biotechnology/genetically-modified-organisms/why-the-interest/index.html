<p>A big part of the answer lies in agriculture. The world population is steadily increasing and shows no signs of slowing down. With an additional 80 million people per year it&#39;s estimated that the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e9/World_population_evolution.png">world&#39;s population</a> could double over the next several decades. The fastest growing regions on earth are also among the least able to provide food. Over time the situation will only get worse.</p>
<p>On the other hand, world food production has been fairly stable over the last 30 years. The Green Revolution of the 60&#39;s gave an increase in new seed varieties. The use of irrigation and chemical fertilizers allowed for an increase in production that was quite impressive. But the increases are slowing down.</p>
<p>This means that, as population increases and food production stays flat, it will be harder and harder to feed the world&#39;s population without putting much more land into agricultural production. That&#39;s land that will also be needed for housing, transportation and other types of human development. Also some land is simply not useful for growing crops.</p>
<p>If we can&#39;t make more land or fewer people then increasing plant production is necessary.</p>

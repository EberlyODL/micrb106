<p>The first genetically modified food was the tomato. The FDA approved the Flavr Savr tomato in 1994 but the company that produced it was not able to make it work financially. The idea was to create a tomato that ripened on the vine but would stay firm and would thus have a longer shelf life.</p>
<p>Another company tried to place a gene from arctic flounder into a tomato in an effort to make the plant resistant to frost. Again, this tomato plant was not a commercial success even though it was used by opposition groups to demonize the technology. In recent years a tomato has been developed that is resistant to salt. Normally tomato plants would not be able to grow in soils that contain much salt. This product would allow farmers to use the estimated 25 million acres of farmland that's lost each year when it becomes too salty to use any longer.</p>
<h2>Golden Rice, the Golden Child of GMO's</h2>

<p>Golden rice was created by Peter Beyer and Ingo Potrykus who published their results in the journal <em>Science</em>

 in 2000. A gene for beta carotene production was transferred from a daffodil into a rice plant. This is a precursor for the production of Vitamin A and Vitamin A deficiency affects a huge number of women and children around the world each year. The WHO estimates 140-250 million children under the age of 5 are affected by this vitamin deficiency.</p>
<p>Since people eat more rice worldwide than any other foodstuff, the idea was to enrich the rice with another, less common nutrient. In this way the need to ship bottles of Fintstones vitamins is reduced for those in need of basic nutrition. Most people in the world don't get to eat as well as we do here in the US. More recently a new variety (Golden Rice 2) has been introduced that has 20X the beta carotene of the original golden rice.</p>
<p>Opponents of golden rice have argued that this is nothing more than a temporary fix for the underlying problem of world hunger, poverty, and malnutrition. Those affected by Vitamin A deficiency are equally at risk of deficiency in other vitamins as well. One genetically engineered crop won't fix all of the problem. They also argue that the introduction of a crop of rice like this will naturally lead to decreased production of other varieties of rice. Thus we'll see a decrease in biodiversity. Do these concerns negate the practical value of Vitamin A enhanced rice?</p>

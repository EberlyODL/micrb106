<h2>Restriction Enzymes and Recombinant DNA</h2>
<p>One of the first tools necessary for the manipulation of genes in living organisms involves a set of enzymes that cut DNA. <strong>Restriction enzymes,</strong>

 or restriction endonucleases, are enzymes naturally found in bacteria which use them to chop up DNA for recycling of nucleotides. Unlike some other enzymes, restriction enzymes cut DNA in very specific ways. First, a given enzyme will cut the DNA at a specific place where it encounters a specific set of letters in the code. Different enzymes cut at different restriction sites. This makes the enzyme a special pair of scissors that will only cut DNA at locations we can choose. Secondly when the enzymes cut, they make a staggered, rather than a straight clean, cut across both strands. This particular type of cut leaves a small part of single stranded DNA exposed. These <strong>sticky ends</strong>

 can then bind to another piece of DNA if the single stranded part matches up.</p>

<p>Once the DNA is cut with restriction enzymes, new DNA from other sources can be mixed in to create new combinations. If the same enzyme is used, all the pieces of DNA will have the same overlapping sticky ends. This allows DNA from multiple sources to connect together to create a larger piece of DNA. This new combination of multiple strands of DNA is called <strong>Recombinant DNA</strong>

 since samples from different organisms are recombined into a new molecule. In this way it becomes possible to take a gene from one organism and combine it with the DNA of a different organism. A plant could have a gene from a fish inserted into it. Genes for vitamin production can be inserted into a plant that does not normally make much of that vitamin. One organism can acquire the traits of a different organism and some thing new is created.</p>

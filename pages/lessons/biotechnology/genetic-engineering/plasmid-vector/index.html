<h2>Recombinant Plasmid / Vector Creation</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The creation of a Plasmid Vector involves several steps. A vector is a vehicle we create that will deliver a gene to a target cell. Since bacteria are accustomed to having plasmids inside the cell, these make an ideal vehicle to transfer a gene from another source into a bacterial cell.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The first step involves acquiring an appropriate plasmid from a bacterial cell. These are so widely used they can be ordered in a tube from a scientific supply company.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The next step involves cutting the plasmid open using a specific restriction enzyme. Since the plasmid is mapped we have a very high degree of certainty about where this cut will be. Additionally, we use the same enzyme to cut DNA from another source to get the gene we’re interested in inserting into the bacterial cell. As an example, we could be trying to insert the gene for Insulin into a bacterial cell so we can grow large numbers of bacteria and get them to produce Insulin for diabetics.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Once we have a number of cut plasmids and a pile of cut DNA from another source (the target gene) we can mix the pieces together and allow them to form recombinant DNA. The key here is that we use the same enzyme on all samples. Because the restriction enzymes cut so specifically, every single piece of DNA, no matter the source, will have the exact same sticky ends. Because of this the pieces can stick to each other in all sorts of combinations.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some plasmids will reform into their original circular shape just by reconnecting their ends together. The enzyme <strong>Ligase </strong>helps seal the ends together Other plasmids will reform but will have new pieces of DNA inserted. Some of these pieces will not contain the gene we want. Others could contain the gene of interest. It becomes necessary to find the one of interest among all of the ones that are not useful. That happens in a later step.</p>
<media-image alt="Step 4" class="lightbox" source="assets/bisc002_genless8_clip_image006.jpg" data-style="width: 180px; height: 111px; margin: 10px; text-align: justify;"></media-image>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Next a simple process of passing an electrical current through the cells opens up breaks in the membrane and allows the plasmids to pass into the bacteria cells. Some bacteria will now have plasmids inside, others will not. Some of those will contain useless DNA inserts but hopefully at least one will contain the gene of interest. Finding just one cell with the plasmid containing the gene of interest is all that’s needed to grow billions of identical cells. But how to find that one cell?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The last step involves looking at a number of bacteria on Petri dishes to find the one with the target gene. This is done by looking for phenotype changes since the plasmid we used had genes that would change the survivability of bacteria in the presence of antibiotics. Remember, the one plasmid shown had two genes for antibiotic resistance but cut sites in the middle of these genes. If we cut the plasmid in the right place and inserted a new gene there, the gene for antibiotic resistance is destroyed. All we need to do then is find a cell resistant to one antibiotic but not the other. By using Petri plates containing combinations of antibiotics one can figure out which cells contain the gene of interest.</p>
<media-image alt="Step 6" class="lightbox" source="assets/bisc002_genless8_clip_image008.jpg" data-style="cursor: default; border-width: 0px; width: 180px; height: 111px; margin: 10px; text-align: justify;"></media-image>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Other plasmids can be used that contain antibiotic resistance genes and genes that cause a color change if the bacteria are given different sugars as food. Whatever the mechanism, the change in phenotype can be discerned eventually. This is a long process but again the goal is to find that one cell with the correct gene. From it billions of cells can be grown to produce the product of the gene we inserted. In this way it becomes easy to mass produce the product for commercial use.</p>

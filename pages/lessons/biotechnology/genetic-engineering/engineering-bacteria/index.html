<p style="text-align: justify;">Bacteria are widely used in genetic engineering to produce a variety of products useful to society. Everything from medically valuable proteins to useful enzymes that degrade toxic chemical spills is produced by altering the genes in bacteria. Being small with a simple genome they are relatively easy to handle and of course they multiply rapidly so it’s possible to produce large quantities very quickly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Another feature of bacteria that make them an excellent tool of genetic engineering deals with a unique genetic structure called a Plasmid. Bacteria have a single, circular chromosome. They may or may not also have a round chromosome-like structure called a plasmid. These plasmids are naturally occurring and contain genes that are not necessary for the cell’s survival but confer added phenotypes. Antibiotic resistance, pathogenic traits and the ability to spread the plasmid to other cells are all genes the can be found on a plasmid. Some bacteria can even contain multiple plasmids while others don’t have any at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Since these plasmids are relatively small, perhaps only a few thousand base pairs, they are easily mapped. Using electrophoresis and sequencing technology scientists have figured out the exact letter sequence for many plasmids. Since we know what the letters are it becomes an easy matter to search for the letter sequences where a certain restriction enzyme can cut.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The image shows a map for a specific plasmid. On it you can see restriction enzyme cut sites for the enzyme EcoR1 or Eco521. This particular plasmid also has a couple of genes for resistance to the antibiotics Ampicillin and Tetracycline. We can cut this plasmid to insert genes in specific places and break the gene for Ampicillin or Tetracycline resistance. The resulting recombinant molecule is then inserted into a bacterial cell and it acquires new phenotypes depending on the gene we insert. This is the basic process of creating a plasmid Vector.</p>

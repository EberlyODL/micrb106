<p style="text-align: justify;">This lesson focuses on using the tools of biotechnology to manipulate the genes of living organisms. Using recombinant DNA technology it is possible to create transgenic organisms and treat genetic diseases in humans. There are three basic areas of genetic manipulation of living organisms, bacteria, plants and animals, including humans.</p>

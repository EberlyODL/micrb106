<p>The history of microbiolgy has it&#39;s beginnings in the prehistory of humans and continues through the rise of civilization, and&nbsp;through the fall of the Greek and Roman empires. It continues through the Dark Ages of Europe, includes the rise of scientific thought and ends with the modern advances we know today. It encompasses ancient tales of what causes disease and the story of how those ancient superstitions have given way to modern scientific explanations of the germ theory of disease.&nbsp;In some cases the old ideas still persist to this day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many people have contributed to this story throughout the ages. Giants like Pasteur and Koch and Lister founded modern microbiology and surgical techniques. Contributions by Watson and Crick launched the Biotechnology age. Alexander Fleming ushered in the age of antibiotics, saving tens of millions of lives in the process. These scientists and many others not mentioned have quite literally changed the world since the time your great grandparents were young.&nbsp;</p>

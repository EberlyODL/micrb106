<p>Concepts of life and death have always fascinated humans. Diseases are a major part of human mortality and people have been interested in curing diseases for thousands of years. History is full of examples of the importance of disease to ancient civilizations. Sometimes the impacts have been devastating and have indeed changed the course of history.</p>

The biblical book of Exodus describes plagues in Egypt leading to the departure of Moses and the Israelites sometime around 1400 BC. Athens and Sparta fought the Peloponnesian War and in the year 430 BC a devestating plague killed many citizens of Athens holed up in the city hoping to wait out a Spartan seige. Some historians credit the plague with causing Athens to lose the war and power and influence shifted to Macedonia (Alexander the Great) which eventually led to the rise of Roman civilization. </p>
<p>The Romans were a powerful empire in the ancient world. Much of their success was due to military strength but a significant part of that was their engineering prowess. What made Roman civilization truly successful was their ability to build cities. Unlike any other civilization to date, and indeed better than many civilizations that followed, the Romans perfected ways to control disease in crowded cities. </p>
<p>The key to building a healthy population in a city is to control the water supply and sewage system. The city of Rome had a sophisticated system for bringing in  fresh water and removing sewage that was unheard of in most cities until probably, a hundred years ago. Imagine the city of Rome being far healthier 2000 years ago than either New York or London was one hundred years ago! The ancient Romans had fresh water brought in via aqueducts, they had public baths so the citizens were clean, street sanitation was common and sewage was removed from the city in spectatularly engineered sewers. Ancient Rome was an extremely crowded city but it was a relatively healthy one, especially considering they had no idea at all about how to treat or cure infectious disease. They merely prevented the spread of disease. </p>

The city of Rome itself managed to hold on for some time till repeated wars destroyed the aqueduct system leading to the city's collapse. Since all roads lead to Rome, epidemics and malaria from the local area led to a population collapse more so than actual warfare. The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse struck again. </p>
<p>The loss of this type of city planning led to the Dark Ages in Europe where things reverted back to the pattern of health that was common in much of the world before the rise of Rome. This pattern remained in place in many locations until the late 1800's or early 1900's when the advent of a much better understanding of disease led to modern water and sewer treatment sytems. Even to this day, many suffer and die from a lack of clean water.</p>

<p><strong>Nicolaus Copernicus</strong></p>
<p><media-image alt source="assets/Copernicus.jpg" style="width: 75px; height: 103px; margin-right: 7px; margin-left: 7px; float: left;"></media-image> By the time of Copernicus, the study of astronomy had been going on for thousands of years. At the time he lived, an understanding of mathematics had developed to the point where astronomers felt they could predict the motions of the stars and planets. There was great interest in learning about astronomy and a new invention called the telescope allowed for careful observation.</p>
<p>Copernicus was very interested in the movement of the stars in the sky. The Ptolemaic model placed the earth at the center of the universe while all the planets, including the sun, revolved around the earth. Copernicus was not satisfied with this explanation in light of the fact that sometimes the planets did strange things like move backwards from the predicted direction.</p>
<p>After some work, Copernicus came up with a model that placed the sun at the center and the earth and planets revolving around it instead. Copernicus's idea was extremely revolutionary for it's time. This contradicted the "fact" that everyone knew that humans and thus the earth was the center of all creation. Needless to say, he became a controversial figure even though he died soon after publishing his work. The biggest contribution of Copernicus centers on his willingness to change the way people think about what "everyone knows". He led the way to a new way of thinking about the world, that the universe is very large and changing. This caused some concern at the time because people began to change the way people thought of themselves and their relation to the universe.</p>
<p><strong>Galileo Galilei</strong></p>

His most famous contributions were in the field of astronomy. The first crude telescopes had been developed and Galileo made a better one which he then used with great success. He noted that the surface of the moon was not smooth and first described the rings of Saturn.</p>
<p>Telescopes were among the first tools that got everyone really excited about studying the world. Humans had been fascinated with the stars and planets for millennia and they were used to predict planting seasons or religious holidays as well as for things like predicting the future. </p>

<p><strong>Antonie van Leeuwenhoek</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, there was much interest in the budding scientific community for the new technology of lenses and telescopes to view very distant objects, making them to appear to be bigger. It was only a matter of time till someone wanted to view items that were close by, but very small, making them appear to be bigger. Enter the Dutch linen merchant Leeuwenhoek. He developed one of the first microscopes and became interested in magnifying everyday objects.</p>

<p>After looking at a bit of pond water, he discovered that the water teemed with what he called "animalcules" or animal molecules. No one had ever suspected that an invisible, microscopic world existed all around them. This made Antonie quite popular at parties, demonstrating to people this collection of invisible circus animals. </p>
<p>The discovery of his animalcules brought up an important question, where do these things come from? </p>

<p>With the discovery of microbes, the fight was on once more, this time regarding the origins of these tiny "animalcules" noted by Leuwenhoek and others. Perhaps spontaneous generation did not work on large animals and insects but surely these microbe arise in this fashion. Two men set out to conduct experiments meant to settle this argument. </p>
<p><strong>John Needham</strong>



 conducted an experiment that he claimed proved spontaneous generation to be a fact. He heated chicken broth, let it cool and the poured it into a variety of containers, some sealed. In each instance the broth spoiled due to the explosive growth of microbes. Here was proof that the chickn broth, heated to kill any organisms, would generate more spontaneously. </p>
<p><strong>Lazarro Spallazani</strong>



 felt that Needham must have contaminated the broth somewhere along the way so he boiled broth in a sealed container without letting any air in. While this did in fact show that nothing would grow after a period of time, the critics argued as before, that without air, nothing can live. The question was deadlocked with no clear answer. </p>

 Into this fray enters one of the giants in the field of microbiology of his day, <strong>Louis Pasteur</strong>



. Considered the godfather of modern day microbiology, Pasteur would one day become famous for work on the causes of wine fermentation, germ theory of disease and vaccines. At this stage he was interested in settling this issue of spontaneous generation. So in 1861 (note this was still being debated at the time of the Americal Civil War) he did an experiment that settled the matter once and for all.</p>
<p>A tenacious experimenter, he devised a clever method of killing all organisms in a broth contained in a sealed container yet allowing air to pass into the container. He used a glass flask with a long tube exiting the top. Once the broth was heated to kill any microbes he bent the class tube into an S shape that allowed air to pass through yet would trap any dust in the air that could contaminate the broth. These swan necked flasks sat on shelves in his laboratory for years and years without showing any sign of bacterial growth. Finally there was proof that spontaneous generation was wrong. All life comes from some existing form of life. </p>
<p>In this way Louis Pasteur made an early name for himself but his contributions to medicine and microbiology were just beginning. </p>

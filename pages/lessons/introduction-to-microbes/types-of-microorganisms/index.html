These can be single celled organisms like bacteria, or they may be multicellular, like fungi. Some are rather simple cells like prokaryotes and some are more complex eukaryotes. &nbsp;In the case of viruses they aren&#39;t even a complete cell, merely a protein shell encapsulating a bit of genetic information. Commonly studied microbes include bacteria, algae, protozoa, fungi and viruses.&nbsp;</p>

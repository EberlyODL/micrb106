<p><strong>Microorganisms</strong>


 or <strong>Microbes</strong>


 are tiny living organisms that generally cannot be seen with the naked eye. These can be single celled organisms like bacteria, or they may be multicellular, like fungi. Some are rather simple cells like prokaryotes and some are more complex eukaryotes.  In the case of viruses they aren't even a complete cell, merely a protein shell encapsulating a bit of genetic information. Commonly studied microbes include bacteria, algae, protozoa, fungi and viruses. </p>

<p> The crowning achievement of Pasteur's career was his contribution to the development of <strong>germ theory of disease</strong> and the use of vaccines to prevent these diseases. Pasteur's studies on contamination of wine and beer by airborne yeast clearly stimulated certain investigators to recognize that these "diseases" were due to entry of foreign microorganisms. Pasteur read about <strong>Ignaz Semmelweis' </strong>writings suggesting doctors wach their hands before surgery and became an advocate for the practice in France. He was ignored. An english medical doctor, <strong>Joseph Lister,</strong> was so impressed by Pasteur's work that he began to systematically sterilize his instruments, bandages and sprayed phenol solutions in his operatories thus reducing infections following surgery to incredibly low numbers.</p>

<p>By 1875 many physicians recognized that some diseases were accompanied by specific microorganisms, but the body of medical opinion was unwilling to concede that important diseases --cholera, diphtheria, scarlet fever, childbirth fever, syphilis, smallpox - could ever be caused by these agents. To give you an idea of the magnitude of the problem, according to Pasteur's biographer, between April 1 and May 10, 1856, in the Paris Maternity Hospital there were 64 fatalities due to childbirth fever out of 347 confinements. The hospital was closed and the patients were transferred to a different hospital. Sadly, the contagion followed these women and nearly all of them died!</p>
<p>As Pasteur wandered through hospital wards he became increasingly aware that infection was spread by physicians and hospital attendants from sick to healthy patients. Pasteur impressed on his physician colleagues that avoidance of microbes meant avoidance of infection. In a famous speech before the august Academy of Medicine in Paris he stated, "This water, this sponge, this lint with which you wash or cover a wound, may deposit germs which have the power of multiplying rapidly within the tissue....If I had the honor of being a surgeon....not only would I use none but perfectly clean instruments, but I would clean my hands with the greatest care." Slowly, but surely, through the preachings of Pasteur, Semmelweiss, Lister and other physicians antiseptic medicine and surgery became the rule.</p>
<p><strong><media-image alt source="assets/Robert_Koch_.jpg" data-style="width: 110px; height: 156px; margin-right: 7px; margin-left: 7px; float: left;"></media-image> Robert Koch</strong> was a contemporary of Pasteur's who came up with a set of rules to conclusively prove that a certain bacterium was the cause of a specific infectious disease. These rules, <strong>Koch's Postulates</strong> are still used today when new diseases are identified such as HIV was in the 1980's. His lab developed a whole set of technologies that ushered in what was known as the <strong>Golden Age of Microbiology</strong> in which most known diseases were found to be caused by a specific microbial agent. </p>
<p>At that time, microbiologists were growing bacteria on slices of sterilized potatos. Unfortunately, the bacteria ate the starch and made quite a gooey mess of things. They also tried using gelatin (Jello) but it would melt in the heat needed to grow bacteria at optimal temperatures. One of the lab technicians, Walter Hesse had a wife named Fannie, who was quite a good cook and baker. She suggested they use <strong>agar</strong>, a jello like material made from seaweed. Bacteria cannot digest agar so it made an ideal surface for growing specimens. Another technician named Petri developed a pair of overlapping flat glass dishes to hold the agar for incubation. Fortunately agar won't melt when placed in incubators at 37 degrees Celcius (body temperature) the ideal temperature for growing pathogens. A great step forward in medicine was made due to the culinary knowledge of <strong>Fannie Hesse</strong>.</p>

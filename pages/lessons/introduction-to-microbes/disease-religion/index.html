<p>The intersection of religion and an understanding of disease has an interesting and lingering effect on how we think about diseases even today. People in ancient times had no good understanding of the causes of infectious disease. Since microbes cannot be seen with the naked eye and a functional microscope did not exist until nearly 1700, it is no surprise that no one was able to completely explain the causes of infection. This left people with only one possible explanation, a divine role for disease. </p>

Hippocrates (Hippocratic Oath) and Aristotle laid the groundwork for medicine by making attempts to explain disease scientifically. They recognized something in nature was at work but didn't know what or how. They also prayed to a host of deities who specialized in solving different problems of the natural world. </p>
<p>The Romans followed this practice and had gods for all sorts of human problems and ailments. Depending on your condition, an offering to the proper god or goddess would cure you of your ills. If that didn't work, you were either out of favor with the goddess or did something wrong during the ceremony. </p>
<p>Early Christians were heirs to this understanding of disease and the bible contains many stories of healing the sick. Since no one in that time of history was ever able to cure illness effectively. it was a powerful part of the story of Jesus that he was able to do so. Healing diseases became a miraculous process. Early christianity developed a theme of healing the sick and this carried on down the centuries in the stories of the saints, each with powers to cure one of various illnesses. In a sense the theme hearkens back to Roman practices. During the middle ages, the concept of priest and doctor became fused into one entity.</p>

<p>Even today it is possible to hear people talk about illness as being part of the wrath or judgement of god. Illness is sometimes viewed as punishment for sins. We know it is a process of nature but some still speak of it in this way. When HIV and the AIDS epidemic hit in the 1980's it was common to hear preachers talk about the disease as punishment for the homosexual lifestyle. Since we now know this disease affects heterosexuals as well, the cause has morphed into punishment for a promiscuous lifestyle. </p>
<p>Many denominations have customs regarding food handling that take on the importance of religious observance. Many aspects of jewish kosher practices basically focus on handling food in such a way as to prevent contamination. Islamic practices have similarities as well. These practices were established at a time before evidence of microbes was known yet they tended to keep people more free of disease.</p>

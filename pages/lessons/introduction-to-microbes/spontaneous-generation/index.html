<p>The discovery of the new technology of microscopes came at a time of great controversy in the scientific community. A debate had been raging over the origins of living organisms. Now that science had firmly established that nature behaves according to rules that can be observed and experimented with, the race was on to figure out, well, just about everything. Some were working on astronomical questions that had puzzled people for centuries. Others were working on principles of physics and mathematics, while others were concerned about biological questions. One fundamental question of the time was, where do living things come from?</p>
<p>At the time everyone had a pretty good idea of where babies come from. One could watch farm animals mating in a similar fashion and even birds and reptiles laid eggs. But what about small organisms like insects? It was hard to find small organisms mating so where did their young come from? For example, if one left out a bit of meat on the table, within a few days, maggots would seem to spontaneously appear. If one got a bucket of mud from the swamp, eventually frogs or lizards would appear from it. Where the heck did they come from? It appeared that some organisms spring into being from primordial sludge or putrescence. </p>

A number of prominent scientists were using the new methods of experimentation to try and settle the issue. <strong>Francisco Redi</strong> set out to disprove the theory of spontaneous generation. He conducted an experiment where he put meat into two jars, one open without a lid and the other one sealed. Naturally only the one left open to the air had maggots grow on it. Problem solved. Critics complained however that nothing could live without air so his results were wrong. Redi tried another experiment where he added one more jar. One was open, one was sealed and one was covered with a fine mesh cloth. Again, only the one open to the air (which allowed flies to lay their eggs to hatch) contained maggots. Critics were forced to concede defeat and admit spontaneous generation was wrong. </p>
<p>Then came Leeuwenhoek and his invisible animalcules. Surely those arise from spontaneous generation. The argument was on again. </p>

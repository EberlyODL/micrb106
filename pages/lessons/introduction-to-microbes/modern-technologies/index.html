<p>Since the time of Pasteur we have made great advances in our understanding of microbes. Once those early pioneers were able to identify the causes of infectious disease, others have turned to finding ways to control them and cure disease. <strong>Edward Jenner </strong>and later Pasteur himself worked on the idea of a vaccine, a method of inducing immunity to disease within a person. The idea was to prevent the onset of any given infection. It was long known that those who managed to survive a smallpox infection would no longer be susceptible to catching the disease. Jenner worked on making a vaccine based on a less harmful organism (cowpox) that gave the same protection without subjecting the patient to smallpox itself. Pasteur worked on a similar method for Rabies. </p>

<p>Others have looked for chemical compounds that could be injected into a patient to kill the harmful microbes without causing damage to body tissues.<strong> Paul Ehrlich</strong> was searching for a "magic bullet" that would destroy bacteria but not harm a patient. He developed the drug Salvarsan to treat syphillis. Later, <strong>Alexander Fleming</strong>, in one of the great accidental discoveries in science came across a substance produced by a common mold that inhibited the growth of bacteria. The discovery and eventual mass production of Penicillin saved untold numbers of lives on the battlefields of World War II. </p>

<p>In more recent decades we have begun to understand life at the genetic and even molecular level. With the discovery of DNA by <strong>Watson and Crick</strong>, it became possible to study how cells are controlled by genes. The very chemical processes of life are now known and can be manipulated. In the 1970's we discovered restriction enzymes, or molecular scissors that allowed for cutting and physically reorganizing the resulting bits of DNA into new patterns.  A decade later in the 80's the technique of PCR allowed for the mass production of DNA in the laboratory. Most recently we have come to understand how RNA plays a critical role in how genes are regulated. By understanding how cells turn genes on and off we can invent new therapies to control a wide variety of disease processes. </p>
<p>Even our understanding of disease has change over the last few decades. The microbiologists from the Golden Age studied bacteria in pure cultures and we've been thinking about bacteria in that way ever since. However, bacteria do not live in discrete pure cultures in nature. They exist in complex communities on every conceivable surface. More recent understanding of how <strong>Biofilms</strong> work have allowed for much better understandings of how microbes contribute to diseses we cannot easily treat with standard methods. </p>

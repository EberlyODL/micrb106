<p>The history of the earth is really the history of microbes. While the earth is approximately 4.5 Billion years old, single celled organisms have been around for 3.5 Billion years. In contrast, multicellular organims have only been around for a billion years and large animals like the dinosarus and later mammals for maybe half a billion years. Humans are very late to the game, we've only been around for a couple hundred thousand years. </p>

<p>Not only have microbes been around much longer than us, they have a huge impact on our environment and have significantly altered the course of earth history. One of the first mass extinctions happened when single celled organisms starting using photosynthesis to capture energy from the sun. Oxygen is a major byproduct of photosynthesis. At one time all living organisms were anaerobic, they lived without oxygen since there was so very little of it present in early earth's atmosphere. With the rise of photosynthetic organisms, large amounts of oxygen were released into the atmosphere, killing off the majority of the living cells around at the time. Much of what exists on earth today are descendants of those early microbes.</p>
<p>An interesting consequence of having oxygen present in the atomosphere is the formation of ozone which forms a protective layer to protect living things from harsh exposure to UV light. Plants and animals live on the surface of the earth today because we are protected by this ozone layer. Without the activities of microbes, life on earth would be very different from what we see today. </p>
<p>Microbes live in just about every possible corner of the earth. Few environments are so harsh that microbes cannot grow there. The conditions on earth today are much less harsh than they were several billion years ago yet microbes were able to flourish even in those times. Because of this, it's possible to find microbes near thermal vents in the sea, in hot springs and even on the sides of volcanos. Bacteria are considered to be <strong>ubiquitous</strong>, they live everywhere. </p>

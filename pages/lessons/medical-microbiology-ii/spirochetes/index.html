<p>The spirochetes are a group of bacteria named for the curvy or corkscrew shape they have. There are many different species of spirochetes but there are a couple that are significant pathogens. One is<em> <strong>Treponema pallidum</strong></em> which causes syphillis and <strong><em>Borrelia burgdoferi</em></strong> which causes Lyme Disease.</p>
<h3>Treponema</h3>
<p>Syphillis is a sexually transmitted infection that progresses through a series of step, ultimately leading to death. The organism is a coiled, very thin rod. It is so thin in fact that one cannot see it using standard brightfield microscopy, darkfield microscopy is needed. Treponema cannot be grown using standard lab methods, it will only grow in animals or tissue culture making it extra difficult to study.</p>
<p>Given this need for very specific growth conditions, it cannot survive ouside of a host so there is little chance of exposure from a seat or fomite. This disease is transmitted through direct sexual contact. If untreated it will progress through 3 stages, the end result will be death.</p>
<p>In Primary Syphillis the organism gets through breaks in the skin after exposure and eventually a painless blister forms. The incubation period varies, a week to several months but half a few weeks is typical. If untreated the blister will eventually go away but in females, cervical lesions may not even be noticed.</p>
<p>After the initial blister fades, time passes from a few weeks to several months, but eventually the organism proceeds into Secondary Syphillis. This time the organism has spread to the skin and other mucous membranes causing a very pronounced rash. At this stage the lesions teem with bacteria which can now be spread through casual contact. After a month or two, this stage will also fade away seeming leaving the patient cured.</p>
<p>In about a third of cases, the disease will progress to Tertiary Syphillis after a period of years of inactivity. Very destructive lesions will form on the skin and internal organs. These form in the bones, the circulatory system and central nervous system. This will eventually lead to paralysis, blindness, aneurysms of major blood vessels and organ failure.</p>
<p>Syphilis can be transmitted to a newborn in utero and during birth but the infection responds well to penicillin. There is no effective vaccine for syphillis so prevention and early detection and treatment are key. Identifying people before they move on to secondary stage syphilis is important.</p>

<h3>Borrelia</h3>
<p>These organisms are transmitted to humans via an insect vector. There is an epidemic disease transmitted by lice that sometimes pops up here and there leading to a relapsing fever condition. Here after a week long incubation the patient runs a fever, has a headache and muscle pain lasting a week or less. Then after a 10 day interval the symptoms come again. The cycle seen is typical of this type of infection. In this epidemic form, the fatality rate is high, 40%, typically from an infection in the heart.</p>
<p>Another form of this disease is an endemic one (cannot be eradicated) caused by <strong><em>Borrelia burgdoferi</em></strong>. While the symptoms are similar as is the cycle, the difference here is that the cycle repeats over and over and over, up to 10 times or more. In this case the fatality rate is much lower 5-8% but long term complications are possible. This form is known as <strong>Lyme Disease</strong> after the town in Connecticut where the first documented cases appeared in the mid 1970&#39;s.</p>
<p>The life cycle of this disease is interesting in the mechanism for exposure comes from an insect vector. The Borrelia bacteria live in field mice and to a lesser extent in white tailed deer. These animals are infested with the ixodid tick, about the size of a poppy seed. The tick bites the animal and ingests the bacteria into it&#39;s gut. In the summertime when people are outside they may pass though areas where deer and mice live and the ticks are found in the yards or fields where people recreate. If the tick jumps on a person seeking a free meal, they bite and the Borrelia organism gains entry into the human host. It&#39;s an accident really but the bacteria can thrive in a human causing significant long term complications.</p>
<p>Oftentimes a person won&#39;t even notice the tick has attached to the skin. After a day or so they&#39;ll fall off. Such bites sometimes produce a distinctive &#39;bulls eye&#39; rash that is noticable but a quarter of all bites do not produce this distinctive mark. Thus a person may not realize they have been infected. Even once sypmptoms begin, fever, headache muscle and joint pain, fatigue are often passed off as having other causes. Kids playing soccer will exhibit all those symptoms in the summer just by running around all day. However, the sypmptoms will begin to happen again and again at regular intervals. It is only weeks later that more severe neurological or cardiac problems start to surface. Eventually joints will be affected leading to significant arthritis.</p>
<p>Treatment with antibiotics is very effective if administered early. Since early diagnosis is sometimes difficult, treatment is delayed and these further complications come into play. Even a few doses of antibiotics can be effective if given early on. When diagnosed late in the progression of the disease a patient may be on antibiotics for weeks or months. Of course by then other permanent damage may have happened. There was at one time a vaccine for Lyme disease but it was pulled from the market due to a lack of effectiveness.</p>

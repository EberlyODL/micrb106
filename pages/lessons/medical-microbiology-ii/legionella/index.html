<p>Legionella pneumophilia was first recognized as an airborne disease causing agent due to a large outbreak at the Pennsylvania American Legion convention in Philadelphia back in 1976. Large numbers of attendees were infected over the course of a few days, 80% were hospitalized and 16% died of the illness. This organism, like many other emerging diseases, has always been around, it just sometimes takes a large outbreak to be fully studied and understood. These bacteria grow best at something slightly less than body temperature under elevated levels of CO2. The lungs are an ideal location for growth.</p>
<p>Legionella disease comes in two versions, one milder than the other. The mild form is called Pontiac Fever, has an incubation period of a few hours to a day or two and has never proven to be fatal. There is a fever with this version, a bit of a cough but not signs of pneumonia. After 2-5 days patients recover fully.</p>
<p>Legionellosis on the other hand is more problematic. Most of those exposed do not develop the illness, less than 5% become ill. The incubation period is longer, almost a week, and symptoms start out as a headache then a cough with chest pain developing into full blown pneumonia. Patients will have a high fever and chills. The organism evades the immune system as it survives phagocytosis, multiplies within and then destroys the macrophage. Since these immune system cells are key to preventing disease in the lungs, this makes for a serious virulence factor. Death is due to cardiovascular shock or respiratory arrest. However, this usually only happens in immunocompromised patients or the elderly.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine available for Legionella and antibiotics are generally not effective on this type of infection. Prevention is the key for this disease. Unfortunately, Legionella organisms are widely present in soil and water. They become concentrated in facilities that have standing water such as cooling towers used for air conditioning in buildings. This was likely the source of the outbreak among the American Legion members at the convention in Philly. Some years ago a physical plant worker was infected while cleaning air conditioning equipment on the roof of a building on campus.</p>
<p>The organism has been found in shower heads in hospital rooms. Any shower that is infrequently used can have standing water in locations not easily cleaned. Then when the shower is used it sprays concentrated Legionella into the patients face where it is inhaled. Since patients in a hospital are often immunocompromised this is a significant threat for nosocomial infection. There have even been cases where older shoppers in the vegetable section of grocery stores have been infected. The fussy shopper endlessly picking through produce looking for the perfect item spends time breathing in the mist used to spray vegetables. Ongoing cleaning of these sources will prevent spread of Legionella.</p>
<p>The organism has been considered a likely candidate for weaponization and use as a bioweapon.</p>

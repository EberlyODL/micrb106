<p>The Neisseria family are gram negative diplococci with aerobic metabolism but prefer to grow in an atmostphere of slightly elevated CO2 levels. They are difficult to grow in the lab and are very sensitive to drying out and sunlight. There are two main pathogenic groups, <strong>Neisseria meningitidis (Meningococcus) </strong>which is the leading cause of bacterial meningitis and<strong> Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Gonococcus)</strong> which is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Meningococcus</h3>
<p>Humans are the only known host for this organism so the only way to become infected is by exposure to someone who has it. The problem is, the organism can be part of the normal flora of the the upper respiratory tract in 5-15% of the population. If someone is a carrier they can be infectious for days to months and easily spread to others via coughing, sneezing or kissing. In closed groups, like in military barracks or college dorms, the carrier rate can become extremely high, 90% has been documented.</p>
<p>Exposure does not necessarily mean someone will become sick, but if the organism manages to spread from the nasopharynx into the bloodstream, a meningococcemia (sepsis) can result. From the bloodstream it can spread to the meninges membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord, causing inflammation or meningitis. This is a very serious condition that presents symptoms of fatigue, fever and headache, easily confused for something else. Once meningitis sets in, the fatality rate is significant, 10% or even 15% of such patients do not survive.</p>
<p>Since this organism is present in a fair percentage of the population, most adults have antibodies present in the blood, an indication of previous exposure. Newborns have a level of immunity due to the maternal antibodies present but this protection starts to fade at about 6 months. From that point on till about 2 years old, children are most at risk for meningococcal meningitis.</p>
<p>The disease responds well to penicillin which is also given preventatively to anyone who may have been exposed to the patient. Prevention involves good ventilation and staying out of large crowds if possible. It&#39;s rare for someone to contract the illness in a clinical setting as isolation procedures are normally used to prevent exposure at that stage. The problem is patients are infectious before they are officially diagnosed so the organism is spread. There are 3 good vaccines available which are a good idea for anyone living or working in crowded conditions like schools and the military.</p>

<h3>Gonococcus</h3>
<p>The sexually transmitted infection gonorrhea is also known as The Clap from the a french word meaning brothel. There are only two forms that infect humans and both produce a virulent pili structure that allows them to attach to the urinary tract. The organims inhabits the mucous membranes of the genitalia causing acute inflammation and a purulent discharge. While both males and females can be without symptoms this is more commonly seen in females. In some cases up to 80% of female patients may be asymptomatic.</p>
<p>In male patients the infection causes very painful urination, usually a good clue that something is not quite right. If left untreated, it is possiblethe infection can spread into the testes causing sterility. This ability to spread to other regions is much more significant in females as they are likely to show no symptoms (thus not seek treatment) and the infection can spread to either the uterus or fallopian tubes, again leading to sterility. It may also lead to a condition called Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID).</p>
<p>Other complications come from even further spread of the infection into the bloodstream (sepsis), infection of the heart tissues (endocarditis) and even acute arthritis. Immunity does NOT develop in gonococcal infections and the organism typically is restricted to mucous membranes, locations hard to protect with antibodies. Many strains of gonococcus produce an enzyme that destroys IgA as well. Since immunity cannot develop, somone can become infected over and over again.</p>
<p>Since a high percentage of females do not show symptoms of infection, this becomes a problem during pregnancy. A baby born to an infected mother will be exposed at birth and a common site of infection is in the eyes of the baby. Opthalmia neonatorum is an eye infection of gonococcus that can lead to blindness if not treated. In most states the law requires that newborns be automatically treated for this possible eye infection, just in case.</p>
<p>Penicillin has long been the drug of choice for gonorrheal infections. The first widespread use of penicillin was during WWII and many GI&#39;s were treated for this particular infection aside from any battlefield wounds received.... Given the long history of treatment, gonorrhea is almost untouched by penicillin any more and we&#39;re down to just about one or two effective drugs remaining. Given this rise in resistance, other treatments are now used in newborns to prevent eye infections. Before antibiotics, a solution of sliver nitrate was used. Later on and for many decades and erythromycin or tetracycline cream was used. Due to antibiotic resistance, many hospitals are going back to the old silver nitrate solutions.</p>
<p>Prevention methods are seeing increased attention in the last few years. Infectivity is so good with this disease that a single exposure gives a 25% cance of infection. The incubation period is short, a few days to a week. Again, males are very likely to show significant symptoms right away, a substantial number of females will not show symptoms. In such cases the infected women become chronic carriers posing an almost insurmountable problem for eradication.</p>

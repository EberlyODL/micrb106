<p>When people hear about plague it conjurs up the history of medieval Europe when half of the population became sick or died. There is some speculation about what disease or group of diseases are truly responsible for such widespread death in those days. Today plague and bubonic plague are synonomous with infection by <em><strong>Yersinia pestis</strong></em>, a bacterium transmitted to humans through the bites of rat fleas. The organism lives in fleas that inhabit rats (and other rodents) making it an endemic problem. When humans live in proximity with these rodents they may be bitten by the fleas and infected by the microbe.</p>
<p>From 1 to 6 days after being bitten by an infected flea, the organism will spread from the skin into local lymph nodes where it then multiplies. Eventually these lymph nodes swell into buboes, thus the term bubonic plague. This photo shows the swollen buboes typical of Yersinia infection.</p>

<p>From here the ogranism may then spread into the bloodstream and be transported to the lungs causing a severe necrotizing, hemorrhagic pneumonia. This is known as Pneumonic plague which can now be spread from one person to another via aerosolized droplets from coughing or sneezing. This is a highly contagious form of the disease with a mortality rate approaching 100%. From initial onset to death, the entire process can take from 2-4 days.</p>
<p>In some remote regions of the US in the west or southwest a sylvatic plague is sometimes seen. Here the fleas are found on ground squirrels or chipmunks rather than rats found in cities. The disease progression is the same though it&#39;s usually hikers, campers, hunters or rural inhabitants who come into contact with this form of plague.</p>
<p>Treatement with antibiotics is effective so long as the disease is diagnosed quickly. A infection that goes this quickly is hard to treat so prevention is usually preferred. Control of fleas and removal of rodents from the living environment are a must. There is a vaccine available but it is usually reserved for those who come into contact with such rodents on a daily basis.</p>

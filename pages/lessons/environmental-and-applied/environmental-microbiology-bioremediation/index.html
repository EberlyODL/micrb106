<p>Microbes can be found in nearly every ecological environment on the planet. As a group they have stunning metabolic diversity. Increasingly, scientists are taking note of the unique metabolism of certain bacteria. Some organisms are wizards at breaking down organic molecules that find their way into the environment due to contaminating spills. An oil spill for example will eventually be degraded by microorganisms in the environment but not till after significant ecological damage has occurred. The Army Corps of Engineers has developed methods to enhance this natural effect to make cleanup quicker.</p>

<p>Bioremediation is the use of microorganisms to clean up pollutants that contaminate the environment. This has been done after oil spills, tanker spills of volatile chemicals and release of carcinogens into water supplies. This image shows an injection site where common food protein is injected into groundwater to promote growth of bacteria so they can metabolize a contaminating carcinogen (Trichloroethlene) into harmless byproducts.</p>

<p>There is a tremendous amount of research going on to study ways in which microbes can be harnessed to clean up all sort of environmental contaminants. Some of these involve microbes that occur naturally.Â </p>

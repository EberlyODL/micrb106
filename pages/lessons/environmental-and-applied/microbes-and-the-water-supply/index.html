<p>A readily available and safe supply of drinking water is one of the more significant advances in modern civilization. In some places, even today, such a thing is considered something of a luxury. We take clean drinking water for granted while in many places people only dream of what we use and discard every day. Drinking water can be collected from surface sources such as lakes and rivers or it can be pumped from deep underground. Either way, for it to be safe for human consumption it must contain at least low levels of harmful microorganisms.</p>

<p>Even in countries where most have access to clean water, there are places where the water has to be tested and perhaps treated to make it <strong>potable </strong>or safe for drinking. Many people live in the country outside of city water system coverage and get water from private wells. This water is often safe to drink without treatment. There are a number of ways to tell if water is free of contaminating microorganisms and safe to drink.</p>
<p>When testing water quality it's not necessary to try and grow every single organism present for testing. The real concen is finding bacteria present in sewage in the water supply. Tests are done to look for indicator organisms, coliform bacteria (gut bacteria like E. coli) rather than every single species that may be present in the water. Potable water means safe for drinking, not sterile. Still, finding high or even moderate levels of coliform bacteria would mean the water requires treatment with chemicals (chlorine) before allowing people to drink it. The following shows a filter method of screening water for these indicator organisms.</p>

<p><strong>Wastewater Treatment</strong></p>
<p>As important as it is having clean drinking water to begin with, it's also important to be careful not to contaminate it for others. One of the easiest ways to provide clean drinking water is to treat wastewater rather than release it directly into the environment. Disease often becomes widespread when untreated sewage is released directly into streams and rivers where people go to get their drinking water.</p>
<p>Simple waste treatment systems are easily installed for individual homes in places where there is no access to a community treatment plant. A home septic system collects waste, allows solids to settle into a tank and bacteria break down much of the solids into simple macromolecules. Only undigestible solids remain behind in the storage tank. Finally the system discharges the liquid portion into a drainfield. Soil is amazingly good at filtering such liquids and returning them to the water table. Such a system has to be in good condition and functioning properly but if correctly built and maintained, is perfectly safe for the local water supply.</p>

<p>Much larger systems are constructed to treat wastewater for entire towns or cities. The process is similar. Sewage is collected into large tanks where solids are deposited and eventually removed for disposal. This is the <strong>primary stage</strong>. The liquid portion then enters a <strong>secondary stage</strong> where more solids are removed and microbes digest the materials. In this stage mixing and aeration take place to accelerate the process. Finally, in the<strong> tertiary stage</strong> the remaining liquids are further treated, chlorine is often added, and eventually discharged into a local water source. Water is returned to the environment as clean as it was when first removed. The following image shows the entire process. Click on the image for a larger view.</p>

<h3>Alcoholic Beverages</h3>
<p>Microbes have long been used to convert fruit and grain into liquid products that can be preserved for a long time. Archaeology has suggested that humans were fermenting grapes into wine as long as 8,000 years ago. Rice can be fermented into an alcoholic drink. Barley and other grains are used to make beer and hard spirits. Potatoes are used as a carbohydrate source to make some vodka. Fruits are used to make cider. Even honey can be fermented to produce meade. Humans have a long list of materials on hand to provide a sugar source which can be fermented by microbes to produce alcoholic drinks.</p>
<p>While the sugar source varies, the fermentation process is basically the same. Fruit is squeezed to release the juice. Grains are soaked in water to allow them to sprout resulting in the production of a mash. The result is a watery mix of lots of carbohydrates that yeast can then convert into alcohol by the process of fermentation. The processes vary widely in the type of yeast used and the amount of time it takes. Also the combination of sugars plays a role in the flavor of the end product and the amount of alcohol that is generated. Some beverages contain 2-3% alcohol, other may have 10 to 12% alcohol and others like mead or some wine may contain close to 20% alcohol.</p>
<p>Once the 20% threshold is reached, the alcoholic beverage is considered a spirit. It is possible to take the alcoholic mash and increase the alcohol content to much higher levels, 80% or 90%. While this higher level is possible, most spirits are typically around 40%. Rum, whiskey, brandy and vodka are all examples of spirits.</p>
<p>This higher concentration of alcohol is accomplished by distillation. Since alcohol has a lower point point than water it will quickly evaporate when heated. This alcohol "steam" passes through piping where the heat is dissipated and the alcohol condensed back into liquid form. This liquid will contain some water but will mostly be concentrated alcohol.</p>
<p>While the spirit will contain some of the flavor of the carbohydrates additional character is obtained by storing the alcohol in wooden barrels. Often times these barrels are charred on the inside to create a charcoal layer. The spirits are stored in the barrels for months or years to slowly absorb the chemical compounds in the wood which gives it a unique color and flavor. Different woods impart different flavors and the time spent in the barrel makes a difference as well. This is why distilled spirits stored for longer periods of time are more expensive. In stores, 15 year scotch is more expensive than 5 year scotch.</p>
<p>Wine is also stored in barrels for long periods of time, but unlike distilled spirits, wine is still undergoing the fermentation process in the barrel.</p>

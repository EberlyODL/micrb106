<p>The other key nutrient cycle that relies heavily on microbes centers on Nitrogen, a required part of many organic molecules, amino acids for example. Nitrogen is a bit tricky because some forms are unusable by living cells but in other forms it can be readily incorporated into organic molecules. Like oxygen or carbon dioxide, nitrogen exists as a gas in the atmosphere, N2. Unlike those other gasses, N2 cannot be directly used in metabolism. Certain microbes have the ability to &#39;fix nitrogen&#39; into a useable form.</p>
<p>Bacteria like Azotobacter and Clostridium species live in the soil and have the ability to convert nitrogen gas into an organic form. Even more importantly are the Rizobium bacteria who live in a symbiotic relationship with certain plants. Legumes are a category of plant that include soybeans, clover, peas and alfalfa. Within the roots of these plants are nodules where the nitrogen fixing Rizobium bacteria live. Here the bacteria take gaseous nitrogen (N2) and convert it to ammonia (NH3). Once turned into this form the nitrogen is easily incorporated into various amino acids and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>The image below shows the complex organization found in the root structure of legumes where these bacteria live.</p>

<p>Humans have used microbes for food production so far back into history it predates writing. Once humans began to form agrarian civilizations and likely even back to the hunter/gatherer period, microbes were used to transform common food sources in ways that helped preserve them from spoilage. Bread is light and airy due to gasses produced during fermentation of dough. Dairy products all come from microbial transformations of milk. Adult beverages (alcoholic drinks) come from the fermentation of fruits and grains by common yeasts. While we have certainly fine tuned the process, these common foods were being produced thousands of years ago, certainly without a clear understanding of the chemistry involved.</p>
<p>Milk can be used to create a wide variety of dairy products. Butter, buttermilk, custard, yogurt,  and sour cream. And then of course there are the various forms of cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, swiss cheese, cheddar cheese and another hundred or more types and flavors. Some of these dairy products are made by fermenting milk using various microbes.</p>
<p>No one really knows when the first cheese was made. Likely humans in lots of places around the globe started making cheese independently. <strong>Cheese </strong>is formed by the coagulation of the milk protein <strong>Casein</strong>. Bacteria take milk sugars and ferment them into lactic acid. This acidification causes the milk to form curds, the basic soft material that is formed into the shape of the cheese, often times round slabs. Some cheeses are then coated with a particular mold or bacteria during the aging process which ferments the cheese to produce different flavors and textures.</p>
<p>Lactococcus, Lactobacillus and some Streptococci are used in the fermentation process. Propionibacter is used to make swiss cheese because it produces carbon dioxide gas that creates air pockets in the fermenting cheese block to give it the appearance of having holes.</p>

<p><strong>Yogurt </strong>is produced by introducing two types of bacteria into milk. Incubating the milk at a warm temperature allows the microbes to convert the lactose sugar into lactic acid. When complete the acidic environment inhibits the growth of any microbes that would spoil the yogurt. Keeping the yogurt in a fridge will extend the shelf live even further. Some yogurt is called live culture because the organisms used to create it are still present. Often if fruit is added the yogurt is pasteurized to prevent contamination but plain active culture yogurt is completely safe to eat. It is actually considered quite healthy to introduce the live microbes into the digestive tract.</p>
<p>The make yogurt, milk is initially heated to near boiling to denature proteins. The milk is then cooled to a temperature where starter culture is added. A scoop of live culture yogurt will work which contains a combination of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bacteria. These are incubated at a higher temperature for several hours to allow the thermophilic Streptococcus to carry out the fermentation of lactose to lactic acid. Eventually, the acidity builds up to the point where the Strep can no longer function and they stop dividing. At that point the Lactobacillus becomes more active and continues the acidification process. After a few hours the milk casein forms a solid and the yogurt is cooled and refrigerated.</p>

<p>The Staphylococci include a large number of medically important bacterial species that are gram positive cocci which are found in clusters. They are facultative organisms that easily grow in culture and produce their own catalase enzymes. While there are a number of different Staphylococcal species, we can break them down into pathogenic staph (Staphylococcus aureus) and non pathogenic staph (Staphylococcus epidermidis, part of the normal flora). Staph aureus is Beta hemolytic, will ferment the sugar mannitol, produce enzymes that degrade DNA and is coagulase positive. Staph epidermidis does none of these things. </p>
<p>One of the distinguising features of pathogenic staph is the ability to cause clumping of blood plasma by using the enzyme <strong>Coagulase</strong>. This enzyme initiates the blood clotting cascade with the end result a coating of fibrin protein around the bacterial cell. This is thought to protect the cell from the immune system. Any coagulase positive staph is considered a pathogen. The laboratory coagulase test is shown below. </p>

<p> Another characteristic of many Staphs is their ability to produce a variety of damage causing toxins. One example is <strong>Exfoliative toxin</strong> which has effects on skin tissue. The toxin causes the layers of the skin to separate, causing a bullous exfoliation (great big blister like thing). This leads to skin loosening and peeling in a large area requiring treatment almost like a burn patient.</p>
<p>Another common toxin produced by some Staphs is an <strong>Enterotoxin</strong>. A subtype of an exotoxin, the Enterotoxin found in Staph is produced by half of all coagulase positive strains. The toxin can withstand brief boiling and degredation by stomach enzymes so it passes on into the intestinal tract where it causes significant abdominal discomfort.</p>
<p>In addition to toxin production, some strains of Staphylococcus are extra dangerous due to the buildup of antibiotic resistance. Since these Staphs produce toxins, are commonly found on the skin and are capable of causing significant disease, adding the ability to resist treatment by antibiotics makes them a particularly dangerous organism. <strong>MRSA </strong>or methicillin-resistant Staphyloccus aureus, is one of the banes of hospitals and modern medicine.</p>
<p>This organism is easily spread, can possibly be found on most any surface and is highly resistant to most antibiotics. This makes it of particular interest in hospital settings. One of the most dangerous <strong>nosocomial</strong> (hospital transmitted) diseases out there is MRSA. Even worse, in recent years people are contracting this organism outside of hospitals in the general community where control methods are much harder to maintain.</p>

It is the second leading cause of meningitis behind Nieseria and causes other types of infections as well. A gram positive diplococci, they form a capsule (seen here as a halo) which is a major virulence factor. In fact, the larger the capsule, the more dangerous the particular strain. These bacteria are only found in the upper respiratory tract of animals and they require elevated levels of CO2 for growth as this mimics their natural habitat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bacteria are alpha hemolytic on blood agar and are sensitive to <strong>optochin</strong> which makes for a useful clinical test to distinguish this organism from other Type A Streps. They secrete <strong>Pneumolysin</strong>, a toxin that slows the action of the cilia in the upper respiratory tract. This leads to a buildup of mucus and fluids in the lung tissue creating the perfect environment for the organism. Eventually, bleeding in the lungs allows the organism to gain entry to the bloodstream. Then other disease complications like bacteremia and even meningitis kick in. If the disease progresses to these stages, the mortality rate is between 10 and 15%.&nbsp;</p>

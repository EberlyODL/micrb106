<p>The Streptococci include a large number of medically important bacterial species that are gram positive cocci that are found in pairs or chains. They are facultative anaerobes that grow in oxygen rich environments but lack aerobic metabolism. They do not produce the enzyme catalase but they do produce a <strong>hemolysin</strong> to break up red blood cells to release the catalse inside. This ability gives rise to one of the methods used to classify Streps, by the hemolysis pattern they make on blood agar. </p>
<p>There are 3 types of hemolysis patterns on blood agar, Alpha, Beta and Gamma hemolysis.  <strong>Beta hemolysis </strong>is a complete destruction of red blood cells  which is a sign of a pathogenic streptococcus. This is show by letter A in the photo. <strong>Alpha hemolysis</strong> is an incomplete destruction of  red blood cells, which does not typically indicate a pathogenic streptococcus. Here the agar looks discolored or greenish from the release of the hemoglobin from some of the red blood cells. This is shown in letter B of the photo. The streptococci that are part of our normal flora, the <strong>Viridans</strong> streptococci, tend to be alpha hemolytic. Viridans streptococci tend not to be pathogenic unless they accidentally get into the bloodstream. Finally,<strong> Gamma hemolysis</strong> is the catetory for no hemolysis, no reaction at all on blood agar. </p>

This Lancefield grouping system places streps into groups by letter, Group A streps, Group B streps, ect. Some groups produce hemolysins, others do not. Most of the main pathogens are in Group A.</p>

This allows pathogenic streps to attach to surfaces, one of the steps of the infection cycle. <strong>Lipoteichoic acid (LTA)</strong> is another virulence factor that also aids in attachment. Group A streptococci are pathogenic due to the M protein, LTA and a capsule that contains hyaluronic acid, (commonly found in connective tissue) that allows the cell to avoid phagocytosis. In effect, the immune system does not recognize the cell to attack it. Taken together these 3 factors allow the bacteria to avoid and block immune system responses.</p>

The enzymes produced by the streps will digest connective tissue fibers while others degrade DNA and RNA. There are a pair of hemolysins, <strong>streptolysin S</strong> and <strong>streptolysin O</strong> which at high concentration form holes in the membranes of white blood cells, very much in the same way that the complement cascade works. Finally, some Streptococci produce Erythrogenic toxin which causes<strong> scarlet fever rash</strong>. This toxin is encoded on a lysogenic phage (a bacterial virus that remains dormant within the bacterial cell). It is not a genetic trait the bacteral cell itself has on its chromosome. A patient with scarlet fever rash is shown here.</p>

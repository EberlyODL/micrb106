<p>Pathogenic Group A streps like <strong>Streptococcus pyogenes</strong>, can cause a variety of clinical diseases. They are grouped based on the end result of the damage they do. Somtimes they will induce an overreaction by the host defenses, sometimes the disease they cause is dependant on the portal of entry. The types of diseses caused by the Streptococci are summarized below. </p>

<p>If the portal of entry is via the uterus during childbirth, the result is <strong>puerperal fever</strong> (childbed fever). One of the first concerns of early microbiologists like Louis Pasteur and Ignaz Semmelweis, childbed fever used to kill 5-10% of all mothers giving birth. Today in the age of antibiotics, other types of birthing complications far outweigh the odds of a patient dying from infection. </p>
<p>When Streptococci enter though breaks in the skin it leads to a contagious condition called Impetigo and also Erysipelas or cellulitis. These skin lesions are often also colonized with Staphylococcus aureus. </p>

<p>One of the most common infections is simple <strong>Strep throat</strong> when that becomes the portal of entry. Most people have had this as children though many adults still get it. In children this infection is often subacute or subclinical meaning they do not routinely develop noticeable symptoms. Children have a tendency for this type of infection to move to the ears (otitis media) and potentially even cause meningitis, a serious brain infection. In older children and adults the symptoms of strep throat are more pronounced; soreness, fever, basically feeling very sick. Strep throat is a common cause of tonsilitis and many have people have had their tonsils removed to prevent continuous reocurrences. In some cases, the bacterial strain may produce the erythrogenic toxin and cause the Scarlet Fever rash. </p>
<p>Group A streps also stimulate the immune system to react inappropriately which causes two other significant diseases. <strong>Acute Glomerulonephritis</strong> becomes a problem several weeks after one of the previously mentioned infections by a Group A strep, often a skin infection. The antibodies produced during that infection against the M Protein (part of the cell surface) will also react with the filter portions of the kidney. In an attempt to target a streptococcal M Protein, the immune system antibodies end up also targeting the kidneys.</p>
<p>Another example this type of attack is seen in the case of Rheumatic Fever. A respiratory strep infection leads to the production of antibodies that attack joints and even parts of the heart including heart valves. Anyone who has been diagnosed with <strong>Rheumatic Fever</strong> has to be very careful not to come down with another streptococcal infection as even more antibodies would be produced a second or third time, causing more and more heart or joint damage each time. </p>

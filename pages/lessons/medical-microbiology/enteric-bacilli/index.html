<p>The enteric Bacilli are a collection of gram negative rods that inhabit the intestinal tract of humans and animals. Some are part of the normal flora, a few are opportunistic pathogens and a few, profiled here, are true pathogens. Salmonella is a significant cause of food poisoning. Shigella is the causative agent of Dysentary. E. Coli is a common intestinal organism but a few strains are pathogenic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of these bacterial species has many different possible strains. Telling them apart is an important part of epidemiological tracking of outbreaks. The enteric bacilli are categorized based on 3 antigenic markers:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>H</strong> marker is a flagella, E.coli alone has 50 types</li>
	<li>The <strong>O</strong> marker is a cell wall antigen, E.coli has well over 150 types</li>
	<li>The <strong>K</strong> marker is a capsule (Kapsel in german) and E. coli has over 90 types</li>
</ul>
<p>Each strain of these can be identified by the strain number for each marker. E.coli O1:K1:H7 would be an example. Sometimes they leave out the K marker so you&#39;ll see O157:H7 as a strain associated with a particular outbreak. Some strains are more virulent than others and not all are even pathogenic.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Salmonella</h3>
<p>&nbsp;It is estimated that of the 50,000,000 cases of Salmonella infections worldwide, 500,000 are fatal, mostly in developing nations. That&#39;s a 10% fatality rate! Humans become infected via the oral-fecal route of tranmsission from contaminated food and water. There are three forms of disease associated with Salmonella, the first two being the most important: Enteric fevers (Typhoid), Gastroenteritis (food poisoning) and Septicemia.</p>
<p>Typhoid is caused by <em>S. typhi</em> exposure, followed by a couple week incubation period leading to a high fever. Achiness, headache and a dry cough are other symptoms. As the fever lasts a week, the intestinal tract becomes the focus point. After another week of severe discomfort the illness will generally resolve itself in the third week. Unless the patient becomes severely dehydrated or there is a perforation of the bowel, the mortality rate is relatively low, less than 10%.</p>
<p>However, since the gall bladder is routinely infected, a recovered patient can remain in the carrier state, without being aware of it. About 3% of&nbsp;those infected become carriers.&nbsp;A rather famous case was that of Typhoid Mary, a cook who infected many people before the authorities were able to track her down and treat her. This was an early case of epidemiology that held found modern day institutions like city and county health departments and the CDC.</p>
<p>Gastroenteritis cases come from contaminated meat and poultry products. While much less severe than typhoid, food poisoning infections from Salmonella can be quite unpleasant. Symptoms begin as early as 12 hours but may take a day or two before appearing. The course if infection lasts something less than a week. Since the organims involved (S. typhimurium and S enteritidis) are found in poultry, their eggs, swine and even reptiles, basic sanitary precautions are necessary to prevent the spread. Thoroughly cooking these products as well as careful washing of hands and kitchen implements will usually do the trick.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Shigella</h3>
<p>There are a handful of specific shigella that cause an illness called shigellosis or bacillary <strong>dysentery</strong>. The spread of dysentary is very similar to salmonella, typically contaminated water, particularly in developing nations. The symptoms include watery stool that contains blood and mucus. Nausea, vomiting and intense abdominal pain are also typical.</p>
<p>Unlike a salmonella infection where one has to ingest huge numbers of cells to cause disease, in dysentery as few as a hundred cells can cause the illness. Shigella are very tolerant of stomach acids so they pass through into the small intestine where they multiply and cause the disease. The incubation period is short, just a few days, and then symptoms begin. Shigella produce an exotoxin, <strong>shigatoxin</strong>, that degrades the lining of the intestinal tract. If severe enough, it can eat a hole right through the bowel, a fatal situation.</p>
<p>As with other oral-fecal route food poisonings, dealing with contaminated food and drink is paramount. A safe water supply is critical as is effective sewage treatment. This is one of the reasons one sees the signs in restaurant bathrooms: "Employees must wash hands". Human to human spread is caused by un-hygenic conditions which can be prevented if hygenic controls are used by all food handlers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Escherichia Coli</h3>
<p>&nbsp;This organism is the predominant facultative bacterium in the intestinal tract. Normally considered&nbsp; harmless&nbsp;normal flora, some strains of E. coli are quite pathogenic. There are 4&nbsp;groups of&nbsp;E. coli that cause intestinal disease in humans. &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enteroinvasive (EIEC): cells invade epithelial lining and cause a diease with symptoms similar to dysentary</li>
	<li>Enterotoxigenic (ETEC): a toxin similar to cholera toxin distubs water balance in colon leading to high volume diarrhea</li>
	<li>Enteropahtogenic (EPEC): cell attachment disrupts normal function of epithelial lining</li>
	<li>Enterohemorrhagic (EHEC): strain produces a toxin very similar to Shiga toxin, dysentary symptoms</li>
</ul>
<p>The last category is the most significant health concern as this is the strain most commonly seen in E. coli based food poisoning (E. coli O157:H7) reported in the news. In some cases E. coli infections can spread into the urinary tract and lead to<strong> Hemolytic Urinary Syndrome</strong> which can cause kidney failure.</p>
<p>As before, control rests on prevention and careful food handling. Clean water supplies and sanitation are basic to preventing most of these diseases. Keep in mind that not all countries have the same water quality controls. When people travel they often are exposed to organisms at levels they may not be accustomed to back home. Even when people&nbsp;drink bottled water when traveling, be careful, that ice cube used in the drink may be contaminated even if the beverage itself is not. Some basic planning can prevent someone from experiencing&nbsp;travellers&#39; diarrhea, Montezuma&#39;s revenge, the Aztec 2-step, Dehli belly or the Gringo Gallop....&nbsp;</p>

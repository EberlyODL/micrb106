<p>The question of what is a virus does not have as easy an answer as one may think. Viruses are somewhat unique in the living world in the way they function and reproduce. One of the things that makes this a complicated issues is the fact that they are considered <strong>obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. This calls into question if they can be called living organisms at all. A virus cannot reproduce on its own. It must enter and use the replicating machinery of a host cell. Viruses cannot do DNA replication or Transcription or Translation on their own, they need the enzymes of another living cell.</p>
<p>On the other hand they are quite capable of taking a living cell and completely disrupting its normal funtion to do the bidding of the virus. They also interfere with the genes of living cells including inserting their genome into the chromosome of another plant, animal or even bacterial cell. Some estimate that up to 10% of our genes are of viral origin. Whether it makes sense to consider them living or not we do tend to consider them active or inactive virus particles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The viral world is just as large and diverse as the bacterial world. Viruses tend to be highly specific for the type of cell they infect. There are viruses that infect animals cells, others infect plant cells and some viruses infect bacterial cells. These are called <strong>bacteriophage</strong> or just <strong>phage</strong>. Aside from the preferred host, viruses are categorized according to their structure, helical or icosahedral for example. Sometimes viruses are cataloged based on the type of nucleic acids they contain, DNA or RNA. Some viral like particles don&#39;t have a structure simlar to any of these, <strong>prions</strong> are merely a bit of protein, capable of invading a host cell. It&#39;s a large and sometimes strange world; we will only be able to begin to discuss the world of viruses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The heart of any virus are the genes they carry. Unlike other cells we&#39;ve discussed, viruses do not have to rely on double stranded DNA as their method of storing information in the genes. While some viruses do indeed have double stranded DNA, other get by with just one strand of DNA. Keep in mind, these are very tiny and they don&#39;t need the huge array of genes a living cells does. The virus will take over a living cell and use that machinery to do what is needed for reproduction. Therefore, viruses don&#39;t <em>NEED</em> that many genes of their own. All that&#39;s needed is a strand of DNA to use in transcription to get things moving inside a host cell. Typically, viral genes consist of &#39;takeover&#39; and reproduction functions. Everything else is provided by a host cell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to this bit of strangeness, some viruses skip the whole transcription part and just have their own bit of mRNA prepackaged and ready to go. Many RNA viruses don&#39;t have or need DNA. They just use the genes encoded directly on their RNA strands to do translation. Some viruses have single stranded RNA while other use double stranded RNA. The world of viruses contains just about every possible option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stranger yet, some viruses, the <strong>retroviruses</strong>, start out with some RNA as the basic nucleic acid. This virus type contains a unique protein called <strong>Reverse Transriptase</strong> that does exactly what it sounds like. This enzyme take mRNA and converts it to DNA, the exact reverse process you normally see in Transcription.&nbsp;</p>

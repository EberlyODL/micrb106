<p>The life cycle of viruses follows a basic pattern that involved entering a host and using that cell's machinery to create new virus particles which are then released an spread out to infect new cells. While there are variations, the process involves a basic set of steps. The Lytic cycle ends with the distruction of the host cell (lysis) and release of many new viruses. The whole process may take a few hours to a few days. </p>

<p>Step one involves the virus particle attaching to the host cell, the <strong>Adsorption</strong> phase. One key thing to remember is that viruses are extremely fussy about which cell they will infect. No one has ever had a liver cold, nor is there such a thing as a hepatitis respiratory infection. The cold virus affects cells of the upper respiratory tract. Hepatitis virus infects liver cells and no others. The reason these viruses infect specific cells involves this attachment step. Typically, the virus is looking for some sort of specific protein receptor found on its preferred host. That's why HIV infects T-helper cells and not B cells. The capsid proteins or spike proteins of enveloped viruses attach to specific receptors found in certain cells. This specificity is so precise, some viruses that may infect the liver cells in a dog cannot infect liver cells in a human. Other viruses can infect multiple species. </p>
<p>Step two centers on how the virus gains entry to the cell via<strong> Penetration and Uncoating</strong>. The virus has to penetrate the cell membrane of the host cell and then the nucleic acid material has to be released from the capsid. There are multiple stratagies involved here. Some have the cell bringing in the virus as part of an endocytosis pathway and then later unpacking the viral particle contents. Others, as in enveloped viruses involve the envelope fusing with the cell membrane, releasing the virus into the cytoplasm of the host cell. </p>
<p>Step three is the <strong>Synthesis</strong> phase where the nucleic acids are copied and viral proteins are produced. Depending on the type of nucleic acid the virus uses, it follows one of a number of synthesis pathways to replicate the genes of the virus. If the goal is to produce a thousand new virus particles, then a thousand copies of the genome are needed. Also, the viral genes direct the production of all the capsid proteins and enzymes needed to manufacture new viruses. The virus is relying on the host cell's DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases and ribosomes. </p>
<p>Step four is the <strong>Assembly</strong> phase where the capsids are assembled around the core of viral DNA and any associated viral enzymes it may have. The last step is <strong>Release</strong> where the viruses leave the host cell to spread out an infect new cells. The release phase may result in the destruction of the host cell. This is where the Lytic cycle gets its name, cell lysis.</p>
<p>Sometimes however, the viruses may be released slowly over time without the wholesale destruction of the host cell. This then is called a persistent or latent infection that may last weeks to decades. Perhaps you've seen the commercials on TV asking if you had chickenpox as a child as you may get shingles later in life. (then they try to sell you their drug to treat this) Someone can be exposed to HIV but not show symptoms of AIDS for years. A few viruses, particularly the retroviruses can incorporate their genome into a host cell's chromosome and become a <strong>Provirus</strong>. This leads to a different life cycle, the Lysogenic cycle. </p>

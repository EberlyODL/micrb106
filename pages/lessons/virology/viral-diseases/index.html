<p>It is not a very great stretch of the imagination to realize that a full review of all the known viral diseases would demand an entire course or whole series of courses really. Viruses impact human health on a daily basis. In some ways, viral diseases are more serious than bacterial ones. Either can easily kill you but at least with bacterial diseases we have a whole range of antibiotics available to treat them.</p>
<p>Until the AIDS outbreak a few decades ago, we had virtually zero in the arsenal against viruses in pill form. We have had to rely almost exclusively on vaccines and our own Immune System to combat viral infections. A virus is not metabolically active unless it&#39;s inside a host cell and then you have to find a way to kill the infected host cell without also killing all the healthy, uninfected cells next to it. We&#39;ll see later that the Immune system has this ability to target infected cells but it&#39;s a harder job than just killing bacteria in the bloodstream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What follow is a, very, very, short list of selected viral agents.&nbsp;</p>

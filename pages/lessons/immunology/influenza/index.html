<p>This lesson includes a "bonus" section of notes that will allow you to complete the homework assignment for this week. The information presented here<strong> will not</strong> be on the weekly quiz. It merely forms a bit of background information that will help you understand viruses and Influenza enough to complete the assignment. See the homework folder in Angel for more information.</p>

He hasn't been home in three weeks so he's happy to be on his way home from Hong Kong. He doesn't look very sick, red eyes, runny nose and a low grade fever as he sneezes and says to the lady next to him, "Sorry, I'm coming down with something". Of course he just doused the poor woman with millions of virus particles. In a day or two she will also be "coming down with something". Of course by then, the businessman will be dead.</p>
<p>During the plane ride home the infected business man had been spewing millions of microscopic organisms into the cabin of the airplane. These flu viruses were inhaled by other passengers into their lungs where the viruses got very cozy in the warm moist environment they found. Within a week dozens of these people will also have a fever, feel very achy and will have developed a heavy cough. Shortly thereafter they will feel very much worse...</p>
<p class="style5">But the problems are only beginning. The passengers of the plane land in the US and each one gets on another plane connecting to a dozen other cities. Each passenger takes the virus home to their families. Just like that, the pandemic begins.</p>
<p align="left"><br>Will this scenario ever come true? Most experts agree it's not a question of IF but rather of WHEN.</p>

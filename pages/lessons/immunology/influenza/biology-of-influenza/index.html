<p>Influenza viruses are enveloped viruses with surface glycoprotein spikes.&nbsp;They contain a helical capsid with a single strand of RNA inside.&nbsp;The virus enters via endocytosis by the host cell takes over cellular machinery and begins replicating itself.</p>
<p class="style1">Influenza viruses are subtyped into 3 Groups, A, B and C. Additionally, two viral proteins that are essential to pathogenicity are targeted by the immune system to help recover from an infection.</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Hemagglutinin (HA)</strong> is responsible for the clumping of red blood cells. This protein helps the virus attach and gain entry into a host cell. There are many types of HA antigen known (H1, H2, H3, up to H16)</p>
<p class="style1"><strong>Neruaminidase (NA)</strong> helps the virus release baby-virus particles that will infect new cells and propagate the infection. Antibodies against the NA protein prevents spread and reduces the severity of the illness. There are many types of NA antigen known (N1, N2, N3, up to N9)</p>
<p>These two proteins and the variant strains are combined to describe a specific strain of the flu. For example, the strain scientists are most concerned about now is H5N1 influenza. This strain has much in common with the strain that caused the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/group/virus/uda/">pandemic flu in 1918</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Antigenic Variation of HA and NA</h3>
<p><span class="style4"><strong>Antigenic Drift </strong>-</span> Minor changes in the two proteins allow the virus to evade an Immune system attuned to the "old" proteins. This change is caused by missense mutations which make a new protein shape (antigen) to evade destruction, but does not change the protein function.</p>
<p><span class="style4"><strong>Antigenic Shift</strong> -</span> Only seen in Type A viruses. This is a more dramatic change in the protein structure brought on by rearrangement of entire RNA segments of viruses infecting different species. For example, Avian Flu virus and Human Flu virus can coexist in a pig host. The avian and human viruses "exchange" genes to create entirely new variations. Thus a "new" flu strain can emerge in humans that <strong>no one</strong> has any immunity against.&nbsp;</p>

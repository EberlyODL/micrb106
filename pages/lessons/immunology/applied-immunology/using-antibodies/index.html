<p>There are a number of therapeutic uses for antibodies in medcine.&nbsp;Much research is going on that will allow the use of antibodies to target components of the body that are not behaving properly. Allergies are a problem for many and you will recall this is caused by an excess of IgE. Antibodies can be used to attack IgE, preventing it from binding to Mast cells. Xolair is an example of this type of drug. Similar strategies are used with drugs designed to prevent tissue rejection following organ transplant surgery.</p>
<p>There are many uses in developing anti-cancer drugs. Antibodies that only attach to cancer cells can be used to target a tumor. If the antibody has a toxin like ricin attached to it, then selective delivery of poisons could destroy the cancer cells.</p>
<p>Other treatments include using antibodies against something called Tumor necrosis factor alpha, a compound that causes extreme inflammation. In patients with inflammatory diseases (like severe rheumatoid arthritis) antibodies are used to reduce TNFA to lower levels. Remicade and Humira are two such drugs you may see advertised on TV.</p>

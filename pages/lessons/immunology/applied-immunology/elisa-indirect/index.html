<p><b>ELISA - Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay</b>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Indirect method</strong> starts by attaching the antigen itself to the surface of the well. Then a blood sample for example is added. If an antibody for that antigen is present then it will attach to the antigen. Now the problem is trying to visually see if the antibody is present. Since an antibody is a protein like any other it is possible to make an antibody that attached to an antibody. When the anti-antibody is added, it will have an enzyme attached to it. Then the enzyme will produce the color change and give a positive result as described before.

<p>This test is useful in testing blood titer to see if a particular antigen has been present in the body. If a person has been exposed to HIV for example, the person will make antibodies againt the virus. This test will detect the presence of the antibodies against the HIV and indicate that a person has been exposed.

<p>The use of vaccines is one of the oldest practical applications of the features of the Immune System. People noted that once someone recovered from a disease they would not get it again even if exposed later in life. The process of <strong>Variolation</strong> involves exposing an uninfected individual to infectious material, either wound drainage or dried, ground up lesion scabs. The Chinese used this in an attempt to control smallpox. True, some later died of smallpox but most got a mild form of the disease and survived in greater numbers than those who were not exposed.

<p>These images show typical cowpox and small pox lesions. Obviously smallpox is a much more serious disease.

<p>A country doctor named Edward Jenner, who experienced variolation as a child noticed that the local milkmaids rarely if ever came down with smallpox. They would often get an infection from cows called cowpox that was similar to but not fatal like smallpox. At a time when the US was only a few years old, Jenner undertook a daring and by today's standards, crimminal, experiment. He vaccinated a young boy with the cowpox illness and after he recovered, injected some smallpox into the boy. The boy did not contract smallpox (he died at 21 from TB instead).

<p>Vaccines work by inducing an active immunity response in the individual exposed to the antigen. Once the exposure has run it's course, the immune individual will have a complement of both antibodies against the antigen and a population of memory cells. While the increase in titer is immediately protective, this immunity will wane. The remaining memory cells will allow the immune system to mount a more rapid and vigorous response to a second exposure to the same antigen. These will provide life-long immunity in most (but not all) cases.

<p>If one wanted to become immune to polio, the easist way to do it would be to get polio and live. While effective it's not a recommended practice. The trick is to expose a person to the antigen without dealing with disease symptoms and potential damage. Two older methods, using <strong>killed vaccines</strong> or <strong>attenuated vaccines</strong> have been used for decades. Another vaccine type is more commonly used now, <strong>component or subunit vaccines</strong>.

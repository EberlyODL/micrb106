<p><b>ELISA - Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay</b>
</p>
<p>Since antibodies are made in response to a specific antigen they are very particular about what they'll bind to. Only the proper 3D structure will allow them to bind. We can therefore use antibodies as a tool to attach to specific things and nothing else. An antibody with a colored dye will attach to specific cell structure and make it visible in a microscope.
</p>
<p>The ELISA test uses these special antibodies to identify specific proteins. There are two different procedures possible in this procedure but each uses an antibody that is specific for only one thing.
</p>
<p>The <strong>Direct antibody sandwich method</strong> uses an antibody that is attached to the well of a plastic plate. A solution is added to the well and if the target protein is present it will attach to the antibody. No other protein can do this since the antibodies are so specific. Once the protein is attached, the only thing left to do is use a method to visually determine if it's really present.
</p>
<p>Here a second, identical antibody is added. This antibody also binds to the antigen and forms sort of a sandwich. This second antibody is special however. It has an enzyme attached to it. This enzyme is one that reacts with a colored reagent and turns it into a different color. If the solution changes color, it indicates the antibody is present. And of course it won't BE present unless the antigen is also present.Â

<p>This method is used to detect the presence of a medically significant protein in a liquid solution. It could indicate the presence of a virus in the blood or even the presence of a particular hormone in a urine sample. This is exactly how a home pregnancy test works by screening for human chorionic gonadotropin.

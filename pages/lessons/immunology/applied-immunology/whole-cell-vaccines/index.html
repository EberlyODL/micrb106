<p align="left"><b>Killed (or Inactivated) Vaccines</b></p>
<p>Organisms treated with a solution of formalin will lose all capacity to cause an illness when injected as part of a vaccine. Therefore these are very safe vaccines. They are also not terribly effective. A formalized organism will have the protein structures distorted. Since the immune system needs a good look at the 3D shapes, these vaccines often may require follow up booster shots over a person&#39;s lifetime. Examples of this vaccine type include the typhoid vaccine and the Salk Polio vaccine but there are no longer available.</p>
<p>Not all diseases are caused by the direct action of a living organism. Many organisms merely secrete dangerous toxins into the environment that may disastrously affect human physiology. The Botulinum toxin is highly damaging to motor neurons, the nerves that control breathing. Also tetanus toxin causes muscle spasms that prevent breathing. A subtype of killed vaccines is the <strong>toxoid vaccine</strong><font color="#0000ff">.</font> A toxiod is an inactivated bacterial toxin that is used to develop immunity. The diptheria and tetanus vaccines are examples of toxoid vaccines. They have all of the same problems as noted above.</p>

<p><b>Attenuated Vaccines</b></p>
<p>Another way to make a vaccine involves using a strain that has become weakened or <strong>attenuated</strong>. In this case the organism is alive but sort of old and worn out due to they way it is grown or even manipulated genetically. Therefore when injected the organism will grow and multiply but (hopefully) not cause the full blown disease. Since the whole intact organism is used the Immune system gets busy going through the process of destroying an invaded. In the end a high level of immunity develops that often lasts a lifetime. However, there is a chance that the weakened antigen will mutate back to it&#39;s full strength version and end up causing the disease we&#39;re trying to prevent. This is not a good option for immunocompromised patients.</p>
<p>An example of this type of vaccine is the MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella. Now there is the MMRV vaccine which contains the varicella or chickenpox antigen.</p>

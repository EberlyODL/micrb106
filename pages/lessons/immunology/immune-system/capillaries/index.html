<h2>Function of Capillaries</h2>
<p>Capillaries continuously leak plasma into the surrounding tissues. Left uncollected this excess interstitial fluid would build up and make the tissue highly swollen.</p>
<p>Specialized capillaries collect this excess fluid and return it to the bloodstream. Once the interstitial fluid enters these vessels, it becomes <strong>Lymph</strong>. The capillaries that collect this fluid are called <strong>Lymphatic vessels</strong>. Lymphatic vessels are similar to veins in the way the fluid passes through them.</p>

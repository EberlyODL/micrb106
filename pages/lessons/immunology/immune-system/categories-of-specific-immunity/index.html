<p>Immunity can be acquired either naturally by exposure to everyday disease causing organisms or artificially through injections.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Immunity can come about through an<em><strong> active process</strong></em> of all the cells working together to mount a response and generating memory cells.</li>
	<li>A <em><strong>passive response</strong></em> would be simply acquiring a high antibody titer without actually producing them inside the body.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naturally Acquired Immunity</h2>
<p>Naturally acquired <em><strong>active</strong></em> immunity is what happens when someone gets sick and recovers. Usually long lasting immunity results.</p>
<p>Naturally acquired <em><strong>passive</strong></em> immunity comes by acquiring a level of antibody protection without any cells in the body directly producing them. Mothers pass on antibodies before birth when Ig G crosses the placental barrier to the baby and after birth when breastfeeding delivers Ig A. This type of immunity will wear off over time.</p>
<h2>Artificially Acquired Immunity</h2>
<p>Artificially acquired <em><strong>active</strong></em> immunity comes about after someone is exposed artificially to disease, as through a vaccination. Sometimes long lasting immunity develops but in other instances a person needs to get booster shots to keep immunity high.</p>
<p>Artificially acquired <em><strong>passive</strong></em> immunity occurs when a person gets antibodies via injection to provide quick, short-term protection. An example is an anti-serum.</p>
<h2>Anti-serum</h2>
<p>Anti-serum or anti-venom is delivered as a form of artifically acquired passsive immmunity. Since it&#39;s not likely the average person will be bitten by a cobra, there is no need to vaccinate someone. If bitten they&#39;ll be dead before the immune system can mount a response. The best solution is to have an injection of antibodies against cobra venom available, in case someone is bitten. Once given the injection, the antibodies will destroy the snake venom before it proves lethal. Injections are also prepared for various insect bites that are deadly like black widow spiders or scorpions.</p>
<p>The injection of antivenom, or more correctly antivenin, is produced by first collecting the venom of the snake or insect.</p>

<p>Once collected, the venom is highly diluted and injected into an animal like a horse or rabbit. The animal will then begin to produce antibodies against the venom. More injections follow, each with an increasing dose of the venom. This effectively increases the titer of anti-venom antibodies in the animal. Blood is then drawn and the antibodies are purified to make the antivenom injections.</p>

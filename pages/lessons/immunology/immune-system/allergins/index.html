<p>Allergic reactions vary from severe anaphylactic shock to a simple runny nose. Allergies are merely an inappropriate immune system response to something usually considered harmless. A person becomes sensitized to the antigen after a initial exposure and the second response is not an appropriate one. The immune system goes too far and causes inflammation. Sometimes the response is immediate and other times it's delayed.</p>
<h2>Occurence</h2>
<p>Allergies begin when <strong>Ig E</strong> is produced after the first exposure so something like grass pollen. The <strong>Ig E</strong> becomes inserted into immune system cell membranes. It becomes the receptor for <strong>mast cells</strong> and <strong>basophils</strong>. These cells have an antibody in the membrane and now recognize a second exposure directly. When there is a subsequent exposure to the antigen the cells then release histamine, prostaglandin, heparin, and digestive enzymes.</p>
<h2>Types of Reactions</h2>
<p>The overall effects vary depending on degree of sensitivity. It usually involves vasodilation on a localized scale (hay fever, cats) to a more massive scale throughout the whole body. Symptoms range from congestion and runny nose or localized skin inflammation like hives to full blown systemic shock.</p>

<p><strong>Anaphylactic Shock </strong>can occur when these chemicals cause the bronchioles to constrict (reduced air intake); many arterioles dilate and capillaries become porous. This leads to a loss of blood volume, blood pressure plummets and eventually the circulation collapses. These types of severe allergic reactions typically happen in cases of food allergies like shellfish or strawberries. Sometimes people are severely allergic to bee stings and can die unless they get immediate medical attention.</p>
<h3>Treatments</h3>
<p>Short-term treatments may include massive antihistamine doses or an injector that increases heart rate to prevent circulatory collapse. Over the long term, allergy shots can encourage production of Ig G by having small exposures over long periods of time. Repeated injections with very small doses of antigen hyper-immunizes a person and builds titer to the point where the antigen cannot get to the mast cells and basophils to trigger the response.</p>

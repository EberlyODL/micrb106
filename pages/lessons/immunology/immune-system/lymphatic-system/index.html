<p>The lymphatic system is described as<em><strong> a system for collecting excess fluids</strong></em> <em><strong>as they accumulate in the tissues.</strong></em> That means that anything that is present in those fluids also gets collected, including any invaders that penetrate the skin. This makes the lymphatic system a good place for cells of the immune system to hang out and attack any invaders that get into the body.</p>

<p>Since the lymphatic system is a place for invaders to collect, many organs that are related to immunity or the immune system also get included as part of the lymphatic system. There are a number of organs that are related to this immunity function of the lymphatic system:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Red bone marrow</strong>: This is the site of all blood cell production including immune system cells.</li>
	<li><strong>Thymus</strong>: This is the site of T-cell maturation.</li>
	<li><strong>Lymph nodes</strong> and smaller lymph nodules: Lymph filters through these structures and immune system cells screen for invaders.</li>
	<li><strong>Spleen</strong>: Similar function as lymph nodes except that <em>blood</em> that is screened for invaders.</li>
</ul>

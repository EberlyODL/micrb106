<h2>Thymus</h2>
<p>The thymus is the site of&nbsp;<strong>T-cell&nbsp;</strong>maturation. Immature T-cells are produced in the bone marrow and travel to the thymus where they develop into fully functioning immune system cells.</p>
<p>The thymus is largest and most active during childhood. Children spend much of their time fighting off one infection after another. It&#39;s really the job of kids to be sick as they&#39;re building immunity that will carry them through adulthood. A tremendous amount of immune system development occurs during childhood. The thymus degenerates after puberty as most T-cells have matured by then.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 19px; line-height: 24px;">Lymph Nodes</span></p>
<p>Lymph nodes are located along the lymph vessels especially those in the&nbsp;<em><strong>neck and groin area</strong></em>. They have a bean shaped structure and they help cleanse the lymph of pathogens and debris. A lymph node is divided into many compartments called&nbsp;<strong>sinuses</strong>.</p>
<p>Lymph enters through lymphatic vessels on one side and valves direct lymph flow inward. The lymph filters through the sinuses and exits through lymphatic vessels on the opposite side. Valves in the lymph vessels direct flow away from the lymph node.&nbsp;&nbsp;During infections, lymph nodes get larger as more immune system cells arrive to fight the invader. Physicians routinely check for swollen lymph nodes as a sign of latent infection. Perhaps your mother used to "check your glands" around your throat to see if you were getting sick.</p>

<h2>Spleen</h2>
<p>The spleen is&nbsp;<em><strong>the largest lymph organ,</strong></em> but it does not filter lymph. The spleen performs the same function as a lymph node but it screens blood for bacterial or viral infections. It also has a role in removing old red blood cells and serves as a site of B-cell activation.</p>
<p>If the spleen is damaged, often due to an accident, then a&nbsp;<strong>Splenectomy&nbsp;</strong>is performed to remove the spleen. If this is necessary, then the liver and red bone marrow take over the function of removing old red blood cells. However, a patient will be more susceptible to infection without a spleen filtering the blood for invaders.</p>

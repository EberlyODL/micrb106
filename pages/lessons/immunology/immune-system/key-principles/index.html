<h2>Immunological specificity</h2>
<p>The immune system has the ability to specifically target individual invading organisms. A particular bacterium or virus can be specifically targeted. Every virus, bacteria, cell, molecule has a unique tertiary structure that can be recognized and differentiated. This shape is called an <strong>Antigen</strong>.</p>
<p>The immune system is designed to know self antigens from non-self (foreign) antigens. In order to identify all the cells of the body as being self, each cell has a distinctive shape stuck in the cell membrane&nbsp;called the MCH complex or an MHC marker.</p>
<p>The <strong>MHC complex</strong> is found on all of our cells. It&#39;s how self and non-self are determined, and this becomes important for things like autoimmune diseases or heart or lung transplants. A donor&#39;s heart will be attacked by a recipient if the immune system does not recognize these cell markers.</p>
<h2>Immunological memory</h2>
<p>Another key feature of the immune system involves the ability of the body to become immune to a given disease. The immune system in a way "remembers" an infection, and the next time it will mount a larger and faster response to the exact same antigen.</p>

<p>This will only be true if it is the <em><strong>exact same antigen</strong></em> the second time. Any slight difference in the shape of the antigen wll require the immune system to start all over again. This is why people keep getting sick from the flu. The virus mutates its antigens so the immune system can no longer recognize the new shapes.</p>
<h2>The Flu</h2>
<p>No one gets the chicken pox two or three times but it&#39;s possible to get the flu half a dozen times in one winter. Why? Because the chicken pox virus is fairly stable--there are few strains.&nbsp;&nbsp;The flu virus, on the other hand, mutates constantly and so it has many strains. Each strain has a different shape, so the immune system is constantly dealing with something new. This is why vaccines are available for some diseases and not for others. The flu shot contains several of the most popular and most troublesome flu strains predicted for a particular year. It&#39;s quite possible to get a flu shot and still get the flu.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t bother with the cold virus as it&#39;s not life threatening like the flu and there are even more strains of the cold than the flu. A vaccination provides exposure to a killed or weakened form of the disease and lets the immune system make that first peak seen in the earlier graph. Then&nbsp;when you are&nbsp;exposed a second time to the more serious intact pathogen, the immune system is going to deal with it faster. Memory gives a better, faster response the second or even third time.</p>

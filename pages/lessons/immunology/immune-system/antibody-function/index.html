<p><font color="#000000">Antibodies are produced by the B-cells and they circulate through the bloodstream and attach themselves to the antigen they are designed to attack. However the antibody doesn't do anything by itself. Perhaps it will neutralize a toxin or slow down a virus, but the true benefit for making antibodies stick to antigens is to help mark foreign material for easy phagocytosis. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Macrophages will find and destroy any foreign material in the body on their own, but they do this far more efficiently if the item is tagged with an antibody. It's like eating plain cereal as a kid. Wheaties or Cheerios were fine but sprinkle some sugar on it and mmmm...good. Antibodies attached to bacteria also help initiate the<strong> </strong></font>complement cascade<font color="#000000">. </font></p>

<h2>Complement Cascade</h2>
<p><font color="#000000">Once an antibody is attached to a bacterium, it sets off a sequence of protein interactions called the <strong>complement cascade.</strong> Proteins circulating in the blood are activated and assemble on the surface of the bacterial cell. The end result is a set of membrane penetrating proteins that form a circular hole in the membrane of the bacterial cell. This interferes with the cell's metabolism or the bacterial cell will lose membrane integrity and burst open, killing it. </font></p>

<h2>Steps in Cell Mediated Immune Response</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">1.&nbsp; The process starts when an antigen presenting cell, usually a macrophage, ingests foreign material and incorporates a piece of the antigen into the surface of the cell membrane.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">2.&nbsp; Everywhere the macrophage then travels, it can present this antigen to any T-Helper cells that it encounters.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The T-Helper cells have a receptor in their membrane cleverly called the T-cell receptor. This is a protein receptor with a specific shape. If the antigen on the macrophage matches with a T-cell receptor on the T-Helper cell, it becomes an active T-cell. There are literally millions of different T-helper cells with different receptor shapes. Only when the macrophage finds the specific, appropriate one will the process continue. That&#39;s why it takes some time before the immune system starts to respond to the infection. Image you as a single person being tasked with speaking with everyone on campus until you spoke with your favorite roomate. It&#39;s possible but it would take some time.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Once the appropriate T-helper cell is activated, it can now proceed to stimulate another T-cell.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; The Cytotoxic T-cell, once stimulated by a T-helper cell, will search out and destroy any cells in the body that are misbehaving. Any cell with an altered MHC, self identity protein will be targeted. If a cell has the wrong MHC, like a transplanted kidney cell, it can be attacked.</p>
<p>When cells are invaded by viruses or become cancerous, the MHC markers become altered as the cell is fixated on other inappropriate tasks. This altered marker can also be recognized by Cytotoxic T-cells and destroyed. In this way the problem is eliminated.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Once the active infection or tumor or transplant is destroyed many of the T cells, both helper and cytotoxic, will slowly die off. The problem is over, they&#39;re no longer needed. However, a number of them remain as Memory cells. These cells will respond to the same antigen if it is ever encountered again. In this way, following viral infections, for example, are easier to fight as there are multiple T- helper cells ready to respond. The macrophage does not have to search the whole body for a single T-helper cell, there are now many. Again using the earlier analogy, instead of you yourself trying to find your favorite roomate, imagine you and all your friends splitting up and looking in different buildings on campus. The job would be easier and faster.</p>

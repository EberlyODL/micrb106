<p>Immunoglobulins, or antibodies, are proteins produced by mature B-cells. Since they are proteins, they can be made in any shape to bind to any antigen shape.</p>
<h2>Structure</h2>
<p>Antibodies are shaped like the letter Y. Thkey look a little like a headless stick person with both arms raised up in the air. The ends of the arms are where the antibody will bind to the antigen. This part of the antibody is called the <strong>variable region</strong> and it's different for each antibody. Each antibody then can bind to two antigens at once.</p>

<h2>Function</h2>
<p>There are five categories of antibodies and each performs a slightly different function:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ig M</strong> - This is called a pentamer because it is made up of 5 antibodies connected together in a pinwheel manner so it can bind 10 antigens as once. It's usually the first secreted during an infection.</li>
	<li><strong>Ig G</strong> - This is the most commonly produced antibody; it is small enough to cross over from a mother to her developing fetus and provide fetal immunity. Whatever mom is immune to, the developing baby will also be immune.</li>
	<li><strong>Ig A </strong>- This antibody is a dimer and has two antibodies connected together. This antibody is secreted in mucous covered surfaces like the digestive or reproductive tracts.</li>
	<li><strong>Ig E</strong> - Inflammation and allergies are caused by the activity of Ig E. Once produced it becomes embedded in the cell membrane of Mast cells and Basophils. Here it serves as a receptor for these cells, and anytime someone is exposed to the allergen, it binds directly to the mast cell or basophil causing it to secrete vasodilators. This causes the allergic reaction.</li>
	<li><strong>Ig D</strong> - This antibody is not well understood.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's possible to gauge the level of immunity by doing a blood test to see how much of a particular antibody is in the bloodstream. The amount of circulating antibody is called <strong>titer</strong>. The higher the titer reading, the more antibodies present, the more immune a person is to a disease. If the titer drops too low a booster immunization may be required.</p>

<p>Epidemiology is a scientific discipline that originally dealt with the transmission of infectious agents. It&#39;s formally defined as the study of the distribution of diseases and injuries in a human population and of the factors that influence this distribution. (Or, why some people get sick and some don&#39;t....)</p>
<p>There are 3 basic purposes of epidemiology</p>
<ul>
	<li>To define the distribution and size of disease problems.</li>
	<li>To identify the contributing factors in pathogenesis of disease and injuries (this is also called <strong>etiology, </strong>finding the cause).</li>
	<li>To provide a basis for developing and evaluating preventitive procedures and public health practices.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Before one can begin the process of figuring out what causes a disease and how to prevent it, there are few more things to consider regarding the scope of the enterprise. First we&#39;ll be sure to include any kind of disease or injury. Epidemiology has moved beyond just infectious disease though that is still a main focus. Whether it is cases if influenza or SARS, people falling down the steps, number of people who die due from smoking related lung cancer or the number of people killed in vending machine accidents (more on that later), any disease or injury can be and is studied.</p>
<p>Second we&#39;re not going to be tied down by a concern for the specific number of cases we track. The definition of an <strong>Epidemic</strong> is the occurrence of a disease in a given area that clearly exceeds normal expectancy. So what is normal anyway? Well, it just depends on what is expected based on past experience.</p>
<p>One case of rabies in a community would set off more alarm bells than thousands of cases of STI&#39;s. In any given population there are hundreds if not thousands of people running around with sexually transmitted infections. However, a case of rabies in a human is exceedingly rare. One or two cases would meet the definition of an epidemic and set of a CDC investigation. So investigators would be very interested in finding the source of infection for a rabies case. Many of you would think someone was bitten by a bat, you&#39;d likely be wrong. Even Wikidpedia lists bats first on the list of rabies carrying animals. Turns our you are as likely to get rabies from a bat as you are of dying in a vending machine accident. That&#39;s dying, not being injured, dying from a vending machine falling on you and killing you (I <a href="http://www.oddee.com/item_98002.aspx">looked it up</a> once). This is why there are statistics, to measure this sort of thing.</p>
<p>The third issue is consideration of geographic limits. Epidemiological studies could include sick kids in your school, it could encompass part of a city or the whole thing, it could cover the entire nation or even the whole world. Any geographical boundary is possible but must be defined. Finally, there is a consideration of a time frame. Studies could look at onset of disease over a few hours or even days, perhaps years. Long term studies on the effects of lung cancer and smoking in pre-teens could take decades of tracking to figure out.&nbsp;</p>

Prevalance is the total number of cases in a population. There are 1.1 million people in the US with HIV. &nbsp;The term <strong>Morbidity</strong>&nbsp;(or Incidence) is the new occurrence of an illness or disease over a period of time, say a week or month. There are 50,000 new cases of HIV infection per year. This is the number of new cases recorded and is a measure of how common the flu or car accidents are. The other term is <strong>Mortality</strong>. This measures the number of deaths out of the population of cases. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issues a weekly newsletter called Morbidity and Mortality Weekly that keeps track of current outbreaks of various diseases. Some diseases like the common cold have a high morbidity but a low mortality. Rabies on the other has an extremely low morbidity but untreated, is 100% fatal.&nbsp;</p>

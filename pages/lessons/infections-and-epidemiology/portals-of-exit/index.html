<p>The last step of the infection cycle is for the pathogen to escape the host and spread to new hosts. The following shows ways that pathogens can leave the body and be spread to others. </p>

<p>Of course the final outcome of all this infection is, quite literally, life or death for the host. By this time either the immune response, perhaps with the aid of antibiotics leads to a recovery of the patient. In some cases, recovery from the illness can leave behing permanent organ damage as in meningitis. Just because there is an abatement of symptoms does not mean the pathogen have been ultimately destroyed either. It is possible for the disease go enter a dormant state called <strong>latency</strong>. This is particularly seen in viral infections like HIV or varicella (chickenpox), which can remain dormant for years and lead to a recurrence much later on. </p>

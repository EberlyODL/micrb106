<p>We live our entire lives quite literally, bathed in a sea of microorganisms. Every surface we touch, every external part of our body, even the air we breathe and the food and drink we swallow is dipped in a layer of bacteria and viruses. Fortunately as we have learned, we have an active and efficient Immune system that keeps these organisms from harming us. Still, it is nearly a routine event that at times we become sick. The Immune system fights off these invaders and we survive to get sick another day. If you've ever noticed, kids are sick all the time. They seem to be in a perpetual state of illness. This is actually necessary as they are in training for infections later in life. Some have argued and evidence suggests that by keeping our children TOO clean and free of illness we set them up for complications later in life. </p>
<p>In any event, given that we live in this ocean of "germs", why is it that some make us sick and some do not? The answer is a little complicated. There is a dynamic interaction between the organisms we encounter every day and how our system responds to them. Even the most harmless organism can be deadly if they penetrate our body defenses and get into an area where they do not belong, like the blood stream for example.</p>
<p>Most of the time, the bacteria that inhabit our bodies and are usually harmless, the normal flora, prevent the incursion of more harmful organisms. We first begin to accumulate these organisms from the moment of birth. From then on, we enounter more and more bacteria until we become colonized with a unique set different from anyone else. Over time that population shifts around a bit as we interact with our environment and pick up new strains.</p>

<p>We develop a symbiosis with these organisms, they don't typically harm us and unless they accidentally get through defenses and into interior organs our immune system leaves them alone. These organisms form a population of harmless bacteria that compete with any harmful bacteria we enounter which keeps them from taking over. Our normal flora protect us and are mostly innocuous.</p>
<p>Some organims however are just more dangerous than others. </p>

<p>To describe the occurrence of a disease, it is necessary to answer the questions of Who? Where? and When? It is important to gather this type of descriptive information because many diseases have multiple causes or the causes may not be obvious. Infectious disease is pretty straight forward, one or two organisms may cause disease X. However, things like obesity, have many factors that influence the progression of that condition. Which ones are the primary ones? Having some descriptive information can be vital in such cases. </p>
<h3>The Person (Who?)</h3>
<p>Age: It is important to have data on the age of affected individuals. The very young and elderly are more susceptible to diseases than your typical college student. A large number of bone fractures may or may not be an epidemic unless it happens to 20 year old males. Bone fractures in the elderly are more commonly seen.</p>
<p>Gender: Some diseases affect males and females differently. Women do not get prostate cancer. Women get breast cancer though males can too, it's just less common. Turns out that combined death rates from all causes are significantly higher for males than females. This difference begins in utero, even prior to birth. Women live longer than men for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Race or Ethnic group: Some groups of people suffer higher rates of certain diseases than the general population. African Americans have higher rates of sickle cell anemia than those of nordic descent. This effect is not limited to genetics however. Among the amish it is nearly unheard of to find cases of cervical cancer due to strict sexual beliefs and very low cases of STI's. In this category it is important to carefully avoid the effects of socio-economic and environmental conditions. Poverty leads to poor health care options and nutrition regardless of race or ethnicity.</p>
<p>Socio-economic status: Occupation, education, access to health care, residence and general lifestyle choices all may affect who gets certain diseases. This information is relevant when tracking epidemics. Occupation often relates to stress which has a very real, direct impact on health.</p>
<p>Marital Status: This is related to mortality for both sexes. The lowest death rated are among married people, followed by singles, then widowed. Divorced people have the hightest death rates.</p>
<p>Maternal Age: For some genetic diseases the age of the mother when she gives birth may affect the child. Down's Syndrome, cleft palate and spina bifida all increase when mothers have children in their late 30's or even 40's.</p>
<h3>The Place (Where?)</h3>
<p>When describing the location of where outbreak occur, there are two basic ways to look at the distribution of a disese. The most intuitive is based on Natural boundaries. One can talk about diseases that are seen in the east like Lyme disease or in the west like Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Based on the animal reservoirs certain diseases may be restricted to certain climates.</p>
<p>The more common types of boundaries used are often political boundaries as these are how data is collected. A college may have a health center that tracks outbreaks of certain diseases. That date is submitted to the town or city in which it sits. That information is often passed on to county health coordinators who in turn submit data to the state department of health. The CDC tracks disease data for the entire United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of outbreaks all around the world.</p>
<p>None of these entities are following natural boundaries like rivers or mountain ranges. They are all based on arbitrary lines on a map denoting which country owns which part of land. Diseases don't care to stop at the border, they cross freely to the next available host.</p>
<p>A look at this map may lead one to conclude that New York has high levels of this infection but somehow it never crosses the border into Vermont. In reality, a different political map (by counties) would show that most of the cases are in New York City and that most of upstate New York has very few cases. The state of Illinois likely has most cases concentrated around Chicago and far fewer in the smaller communities. Or the disease could be evenly spread throughout these states. With this map you cannot tell. Political boundary maps can be deceiving yet they are commonly used because of the way data is collected by government entities.</p>

<h3>The Time (When?)</h3>
<p>Time is used by epidemiologists to track changes in disease distributions throughout populations in 3 basic patterns. <strong>Secular trends</strong> show an increase or decrease over long periods of time. Decreases in the number of cases of polio happened after the introduction of vaccines. What used to be a common, and deadly illness has all but disappeared in the US.</p>
<p><strong>Cyclic changes</strong> are those that come and go at regular intervals. In the winter we see an increase in influenza cases followed by a sharp decrease to nearly zero in the summer months. This pattern happens year after year. Cases of salmonella food poisoning tend to peak during summer months when more people are cooking outdoors on grills. It's a cyclic pattern that follows the weather.</p>
<p>The last type based on time are <strong>Short term fluctuations</strong> or Epidemics. These are spikes in a disease based on an event that may happen at any time. There are two types of epidemics depending on the type of disease. A <strong>Common Source epidemic</strong> is a spike in cases attributed to a single event. Some sort of exposure to a non communicable agent is behind this type. All cases develop within one incubation period of the disease. Food poisoning or chemical exposure is an example. All the cases will cluster with respect to time and place. Since we can identify the agent causing the illness, a specific incubation period can be determined. All investigators need to do is place all the sick people in one location at that given time. Where were all the patients 12 hours ago? They were attending a wedding party where the caterer served some pre prepared and improperly refrigerated shrimp. Only those who ate the shrimp got sick. TIME allows the determination of location.</p>
<p>The other type of epidemic is the <strong>Propagated or Progressive epidemic.</strong> In this case the agent at hand is an infectious one. Patient zero comes down with a disease and after the latent period starts spreading it to 10 other people. After another latent period those 10 people pass the disease onto 100 people, and so on. Here you see increasing waves of cases steadily building in number as the infected spread it to others. This is commonly seen in the winter with the flu among your friends or Norvirus on a cruise ship. Different "bugs" spread through the dorms on campus. Chickenpox spreads throughout the 2nd grade at school. Eventually the numbers cross a threshold number and an epidemic is declared.</p>

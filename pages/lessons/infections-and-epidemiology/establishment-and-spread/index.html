<p>The next step in the infection process involves the pathogen setting up shop so to speak. The cells have to evade the immune defenses, multiply and in many cases spread out from the initial site of invasion. Generally speaking, there are not enough organisms present at the encounter stage to cause disease symptoms. There are exceptions (as in some types of food poisoning) but typically, the bacteria (or viruses) have to first multiply. How quickly they do that depends on the conditions of where they are located and the generation time of the pathogen at hand. Some bacteria multiply rapidly, others grow slowly over weeks or even months. </p>
<p>The <strong>Incubation Period</strong> of a disease is the time needed by the pathogen to overcome early host defenses, multiply and incite disease symptoms. At least early on in an infection, the patient is undergoing the process of infection but is not able to transmit the disease to anyone else. The <strong>Latent Period</strong> then, is a subset of the incubation period. It is the time until a host becomes infectious but before the onset of symptomology.</p>

<p>This means that there exists a period of time where a person is developing an infection but doesn't know it, yet is infectious, and can spread the disease to others without realizing it. For example, a child is exposed to chicken pox on a Sunday and by Wednesday, he is shedding the virus all over the classroom, exposing the other children. However his mother doesn't realize he's got the chicken pox till Friday morning and keeps him home. Therefore, by the time the first kid in third grade stays home with the chickenpox everyone in the class has already been exposed all day Wednesday and Thursday.  </p>
<p>This concept has huge implications for the study of epidemiology. There are exceptions to this pattern however, as in the case of certain food poisonings, some of which are in fact infections. However the exception here is food poisoning caused by the ingestion of bacterial toxins. These are considered <strong>Intoxications</strong> and not infections, so the effects can be far faster. Also there is no way to have a communicable intoxication event. </p>
<p>This phase of the infection cycle is the key one. At this stage the pathogen is using every genetic trick it has to try to avoid or outpace the speed of the immune response. This is the last chance to avoid the disease, usually just prior to any symptoms. A dynamic dance is being played out between host and parasite, will you get sick or not? </p>
<p>Pathogens use a whole host of devious tricks to avoid destruction. Some cells have the ability to avoid or even survive phagocytosis by macrophages. Others secrete leukocidins that actually kill white blood cells. Some have enzymes that degrade connective tissue, allowing the cells to spread from the original site of infection. A few pathogens secrete enzymes that attack IgA. </p>
<p>One common feature we'll see again and again is the production of a capsule which protects the cell by fooling the immune system into thinking it's just a huge blob of carbohydrates. Nothing to see here, move along.... Capsules and slime layers also make it hard for antibodies to bind and activate the complement cascade. We'll see lots of the major pathogens have capsules.</p>

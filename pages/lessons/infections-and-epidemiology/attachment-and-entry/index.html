<p>Just because an organism manges to make it into a portal of entry, that does not mean it gets to hang around and move on in. The next thing the pathogen has to do is gain entry into deeper body tissues or hang on to a mucous membrane surface somewhere. The respiratory tract, the digestive tract, the urinary tract and the reproductive tract all have mucous membrane surfaces where bacteria have to attach to progress to an infection. The Immune defenses in these areas are pretty good but pathogens have the ability to overcome them. Step one of that process is to attach.</p>
<p>Adherence requires two things, some sort of receptor or surface on a cell for the pathogen to attach to and some sort of adhesion protein on the bacterial cell surface. We have already discussed some structures present in bacteria that allow them to attach. These are shown below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without the ability to attach to a surface the body would wash these cells away. Mucous in the respiratory system is continually removed. Food and drink continously flush the digestive tract. Urine rinses the urinary and reproductive tracts. Ig A is secreted at all mucous membranes and skin cells are continuously shed. All of these defense mechanisms have to be overcome or the infection process cannot proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actual penetration of these barriers is possible however. Some pathogens survive phagocytosis by immune system cells and catch a ride so to speak to other parts of the body. Insect bites in the skin may introduce bacteria and viruses directly into the bloodstream. Other types of trauma, like a thumbtack or even a lowly papercut can introduce even normal flora into deeper tissues.</p>

<p>Pathogens have to exist somewhere in nature, a place where they hang out and spread to other victims. A <strong>reservoir </strong>is the place where these organisms exist, their natural habitat. The organisms may rely on a <strong>transmitter </strong>to get from the reservoir to a suitable host. Sometimes these two things are one and the same. A human is the reservoir and transmitter for many sexually transmitted infections.</p>
<p>Reservoirs may be living or non living. These are summarized in this table from the text.</p>

<p>The <strong>carrier state</strong> in an important one in the study of epidemiology. A carrier is someone harboring a pathogen that can pass the organism along to others without even knowing it. Identifying carriers in a population is very critical if control methods are going to be effective.</p>
<p>An <strong>Incubating carrier</strong> is someone who has an illness and spreads it to others. Sometimes this person shows no outward signs of the disease so they are unaware of it. These are <strong>Asymptomatic carriers</strong>.</p>
<p>These infected individuals eventually become <strong>Convalescent carriers</strong> who are no longer feeling sick but still harbor the pathogen and may spread it to others. Sometimes after someone recovers from an illness they become a <strong>Chronic carrier</strong>. In such cases the person is perfectly healthy yet may spread the pathogen to others without knowing it. The following lists all of these carrier types, click to enlage it.</p>

<p>Other common reservoirs are animals. When someone is exposed to and contracts an illness via contact with an animal, it's called a zoonosis or <strong>zoonotic infection</strong>. There are a whole host of diseases that are harbored in animal reservoirs. Yellow fever and West Nile are viral infections that come from mosquitoes. Malaria is another one but that's caused by a parasitic organism. Plague, anthrax and salmonella are bacterial infections that come from animal contact. Influenza is spread by humans but the virus lives and exchanges genes to form new deadly strains in birds and swine.</p>

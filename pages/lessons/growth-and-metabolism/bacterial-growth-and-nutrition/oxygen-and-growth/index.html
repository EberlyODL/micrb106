<p>Oxygen is also an important factor in determining the growth of organisms. Humans cannot survive without it. Other organisms, particularly bacteria may have different requirements. Many bacteria do not need oxygen while some will actually die if exposed to it. Using Oxygen gives us big bonuses when it comes to getting energy through metabolism. However oxygen is also dangerous and harmful to cells.</p>
<p>Free radicals and peroxides are among the byproducts of an oxygen based metabolism that can kill cells outright. Immune system cells use these products to destroy invading pathogens. For this reason any organism that plans to use oxygen to efficiently get energy has a set of enzymes to deal with the dangerous byproducts of an oxygen based metabolism. The <strong>Catalase</strong> enzyme breaks down highly reactive peroxides and <strong>Superoxide Dismutase</strong> destroys free radicals. Not all bacteria will have these enzymes however. Because of this they require different environments to survive.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Aerobes</strong> need oxygen to survive. An <strong>Obligate Aerobe</strong> actually requires oxygen. You would fall into this category. Some organisms, <strong>Microaerophiles</strong>, require oxygen but in small amounts.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>An <strong>Anaerobe</strong> on the other hand cannot tolerate oxygen at all. Oxygen will kill them as they lack the enzymes needed to deal with the dangers. Some anaerobes are <strong>Aerotolerant</strong> and can survive in oxygen even if they do not thrive.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>A <strong>Facultative Anaerobe</strong> neither requires or is harmed by oxygen. They don't care either way. Many bacteria living in your intestinal tract fall into this category. </li>
</ul>

<p>Different bacteria reproduce at different rates. The time it takes the population to double is called the <strong>generation time.</strong> Generation time varies, it could be every 10 minutes it could be twice a day. Some bacteria grow quickly, others grow slowly.</p>
<p>This becomes relevant when considering human disease. A fever will not kill off an infection but it can extend the generation time thus slowing growth to the point where the immune system can mobilize and destroy the invading microbes. </p>
<p>When bacteria are placed into a favorable growth environment, they will follow a characteristic pattern of increasing in number followed by a decrease in number. This can be plotted as the number of cells present over a period of time. The resulting <strong>Growth Curve </strong>is shown below.</p>

<p>The <strong>Lag Phase</strong> does not show a significant increase in the number of microbes present. This is a period of time where the cells are adjusting to their new environment and are preparing for cell division.</p>
<p>The <strong>Exponential Growth Phase</strong> represents a period where the population is continuously doubling. This will continue until conditions become less favorable. This is also the phase where generation time can be calculated. Fast growers will have a steep slope.</p>
<p>A first look at the <strong>Stationary Phase</strong> may give the impression that there is nothing happening. It is a flat portion of the curve that shows there is no net increase in the number of cells. That does not mean new cells are never produced. At some point the population stabilizes, that is, the number of new cells is equal to the number of cells dying off. There is cell division occurring it's just that cells that die are replaced in equal numbers.</p>
<p>Since we have a closed system in a single test tube, there is no way to add nutrients or remove the waste products that begin to build up. Eventually this leads to unfavorable conditions and a decrease in the number of living cells in the population. This is called the <strong>Decline or Death Phase.</strong></p>
<p align="left">Sometimes there is a need to have a population of rapidly dividing cells on hand. Brewers need yeast culture to make beer for example. It's more efficient if the culture is already active and growing. This lets the company avoid down time waiting for the lag phase to end. Cultures can be maintained indefinitely using a culture vessel called a <strong>Chemostat</strong>. Unlike the test tube system just discussed, a Chemostat is an open system. That is, new media is constantly added giving more nutrients and old media containing wastes, is constantly removed. This allows for the maintenance of an ideal environment that supports exponential growth. Then anyone needing some culture just removes a bit and adds it to the brewing vat, and off goes the fermentation. </p>

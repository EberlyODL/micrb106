<p>Bacteria reproduce through the process of binary fission. One cell duplicates it&#39;s DNA and simply splits into two cells. The new cell is identical to the original cell.</p>
<p>When a cell is placed on a solid growth surface, like an agar petri dish, it will begin to divide. The resulting two cells will divide to become 4 which will then divide to become 8 and so on. Eventually a "pile" will form which is then called a <strong>Colony</strong>. All the cells in such a colony are identical, they are clones of the original cell.</p>
<p>When bacteria begin to divide, they follow a mathematical pattern called exponential growth. One cells becomes 2, which becomes 4 which becomes 8, then 16 and so on. This constant doubling of the population produces a particular type of graph. The curved line shows how after a certain point the numbers start to increase dramatically.</p>

<p>The power of exponential growth:&nbsp;Einstein was once asked what the most powerful force in the universe was. He is said to have answered without hesitation, "Compounding interest". The mathematical principle here is similar and it&#39;s worthy of further explanation as this characteristic of population growth has enormous implications for human health.&nbsp;</p>

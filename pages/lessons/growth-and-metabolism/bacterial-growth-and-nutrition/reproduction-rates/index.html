<p>There is an old Chinese proverb that explains the power of exponential growth. There was once a rich and powerful man who was riding a large horse near the lake shore. For some reason the animal became frightened and managed to spill the rich man over a small cliff into the water. An old fisherman was nearby in his boat and since the wealthy man could not swim he rowed over and pulled the rich man out of the lake before he drowned. Upon recovering the rich man became unpleasant and complained to the peasant fisherman about how he was too slow in his rescue, he nearly drowned. However the rich man was not completely ungrateful and since he was rich, decided to give the fisherman a reward.</p>
<p>Now, being a wise old Chinese fisherman and, wanting to teach the ungrateful man a lesson he struck a bargain that he knew the rich man could not resist. The old fisherman merely asked that he be given a weekly salary to keep him fed and comfortable in old age. He asked for a salary of one penny per week. The only catch was the old man also wanted to get a raise now and again and he asked the rich man if he could double the salary every week.</p>
<p>Well the rich man was so relieved and amazed that the old fisherman wanted so little that he quickly agreed and rode off with a story he was sure would amuse his friends. What a sucker! The dumb fisherman could have been rich but he chose a pittance. When the man got home and told his wife, to his puzzlement, she became furious. Since she was good at math, she quicky realized what disaster had befallen her family. "You fool! You complete and utter fool! You have ruined us, we'll be paupers before the year is over." she exclaimed. Being a man, the rich man was puzzled and confused. His wife must be crazy, why was she so upset?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the power of exponential growth. The following is an approximate payroll schedule for the clever old fisherman. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Notice it takes 4 full months to get up to even a few hundred dollars. But, look how his wages pick up after that. In just two more months the salary is over 100 grand. In another month it's a million bucks. Then it's tens of millions and finally within 9 months, the wily old fisherman is entitled to a Billion dollars a week. Now we're talking real money...</p>
<p>However consider the same situation but let's say the old may was paid twice a month instead of every week. You'd think he'd still be doing OK but maybe only make about half as much. Here's a table to show the figures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Holy smoke, that's a gi-normous difference! If the fisherman is paid bi-weekly then he only makes a couple grand at the end of nine months rather than over a Billion dollars? That's correct, it make a huge difference. This has implications when considering <strong>Generation Time</strong>


. A simple doubling of the generation time from 10 minutes to 20 minutes has a significant impact of the number of bacteria produced in a day. This makes it far easier for your Immune system to fight off infections. It buys time for the white blood cells to get it together and start fighting. It can literally make the difference between life and death.</p>

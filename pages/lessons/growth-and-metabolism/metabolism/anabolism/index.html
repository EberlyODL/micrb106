<p>Now that we've looked at the catabolic pathways where energy is produced, it is worth a quick look at how cells manufacture cellular components. The illustration shows all of the pathways a cell can use to manufacture anything it needs. Bacteria are particularly adept at converting anything it can get hold of into any other item it needs. There are pathways to convert fats to amino acids or DNA. All the anabolic pathways are interconnected. </p>
<p>Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle produce a number of intermediates that can be taken out and used to produce amino acids or fatty acids and even reconstruct carbohydrates. Glucose can be converted into just about anything. There are specific biochemical pathways to carry all of this out, it becomes very complex. This illustration summarizes two full semesters of senior level biochemisty into one little picture. (I have a poster that literally covers my office door showing all the pathways and you need a magnifiying glass to read it! That's how many pathways and enzymes are represented here)</p>

<p>Notice how it is also possible to take things like fatty acids or amino acids and break them down to feed into glycolysis or the krebs cycle. These pathways are largely reversible which means bacteria can be fed say, protein only, they'll break it down to amino acids, convert that into pyruvic acid and be able to FORM carbohydrates. They don't even need glucose, they can manufacture it out of other things entirely. Bacteria are extremely resilient in this way, they just need something to work with and they can manufacture the rest. </p>
<p>Our cells are not nearly this good at converting one thing to another. While our cell can do almost everything, there are some metabolic pathways we just simply don't have. In cases where we cannot manufacture an item, we much consume it in our diet. This is where the concept of <strong>essential vitamins </strong>and <strong>essential amino acids </strong>comes from (folic acid is an example). If we don't get certain things in our diet, we can become deficient which has severe complications in some cases. It's not a common thing to have happen for most people but it is possible. Bacteria do not suffer from this problem. They can make pretty much anything they need out of anything they can get their hands on. </p>

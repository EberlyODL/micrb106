<p>The chemistry of living cells can be broken down into two tasks. First, cells need to acquire energy to carry out basic life processes. If a cell isn't doing photosynthesis (which we won't cover) it needs to get energy from an organic source, most commonly carbohydrates. The process of breaking down carbohydrates into energy and smaller organic molecules is called <strong>Catabolism</strong>
. During this process energy is produced and a host of smaller intermediate metabolites are made available for the other major process. </p>
<p>The other main function of cellular chemistry is to construct building blocks needed by the cell for other cellular purposes like cell division. Bacteria are constantly looking to divide and they need to construct all sorts of cellular parts to accomplish that task. The process of creating organic molecules (biosynthesis) and cellular structures is called <strong>Anabolism</strong>

<p>For our purposes here, we will focus mostly on the first portion, the production of energy in the form of ATP. </p>

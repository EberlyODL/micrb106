<p>After the completion of Glycolysis, the cell has a little ATP and a pair of metabolites called Pyruvate that it now has to deal with. The image shows the two options at this point. In the presence of oxygen the cell will undergo Aerobic Respiration. Without a supply of oxygen, as in an anaerobic environment, the cell will do Fermentation.</p>
<p>The availability of oxygen becomes the fork in the road leading to two very different outcomes. With oxygen, more energy can be captured along the way. You&#39;ll get two ATP from glycolysis no matter what but with oxygen you get 18X more energy via Aerobic Respiration. To put that in human terms, if we did metabolism without oxygen, we would have to consume 18X the amount of food every day, just to maintain what we have normally.&nbsp;Can you imagine eating that much food? It&#39;s like some TV commercial where the person has to eat 20 bowls of cereal to the the nutrition value of one bowl of Total. You would have to eat that much yet wouldn&#39;t gain a pound of weight. Clearly oxygen is GOOD.</p>

<h3>Aerobic Respiration</h3>
<p>The image shows that in the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is sent to the mitochondria for further processing into many more ATP, 36 more in fact. This happens in eukaryotic cells but prokaryotic cells do not contain mitochondria. Nonetheless, the end product is the same even though the mechanism and the manufacturing location&nbsp;is a bit different. The overall process is summarized below. Sugar is combined with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water.</p>

<h3>Anaerobic Fermentation</h3>
<p>This process is necessary if there is no oxygen available to process the sugar into carbon dioxide and water. One cannot form CO2 if there is no O2.... However, the cell cannot just keep stockpiling the Pyruvate that forms during the Glycolysis process. Something has to be done with it. This is where fermentation comes in. In your muscle cells, eventually oxygen will be all used up with too much exercise. Muscle cells will then turn the surplus Pyruvate&nbsp;into lactic acid, thus causing the cells to fatigue.</p>
<p>Bacterial cells face the same problem but their solutions are more diverse. Some bacterial species will form acids and not just lactic acid. Other species form different byproducts including gasses and even alcohol.&nbsp;The following depict various products produced by bacterial fermentation.</p>

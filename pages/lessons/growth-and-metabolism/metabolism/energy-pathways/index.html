<p>Although both Prokaryotic cells and Eukaryotic cells use a similar process for producing ATP there are some differences that will be noted along the way.&nbsp;There are three different biochemical pathways used to generate ATP. These different pathways are not used by all cells under all the same conditions. One of the biggest issues to consider at the outset is the availability of oxygen. As we&#39;ll see, using oxygen is a far more efficient process than trying to get by without it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Glycolysis</h3>
<p>This is a process where a single moecule of glucose is broken down into two molecules of Pyruvate. This process can happen with or without oxygen. It produces a pair of ATP as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this stage, the cell can go one of two ways with the Pyruvate. If oxygen is present, the cell will use <strong>Aerobic Respiration</strong> to continue the process and end up producing a large number of ATP. If oxygen is not present then the cell has no choice but to undergo <strong>Anaerobic Fermentation</strong> to get rid of the Pyruvate. Not only are no ATP produced in this process, one of an entire set of waste products will be produced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final step in this process involves dealing with all the NADH and FADH we produced in both Glycolysis and the Kreb's Cycle. This is the most complicated step and it takes place in mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. The process is the same in bacteria but it just happens at the main cell membrane. </p>
<p>The idea is to take these compounds and pull the H off the end of them. Remember from the chemistry chapter that H is the simplest atom, in contains one proton and one electron. When these are separated you're left with the proton (H+) and one electron. The process then involves moving that H+ across a membrane and making a concentration gradient with lots of them. That then powers a system to create ATP.</p>
<p>The image below shows the setup of the Electron Transport Chain. Located in a membrane are a set of proteins called <strong>Cytochromes</strong> which pass the electron from the H along the chain. As this gets passed along energy is provided to move a number of H+ ions to the other side of the cell membrane. </p>

<p>Here you can see all the H+ ions being concentrated between the cell membrane and the peptidoglycan of the cell wall. (we seem to be looking at a gram positive cell here) Once we have all the H+ ions concentrated on one side, we have a facilitated diffusion system in place. A membrane channel/enzyme complex called the<strong> ATP synthase </strong>will allow the H+ ions to reenter the cell one at a time. Each time one H+ passes through it generates a bit of energy which is used to form one ATP. The more H+ ions we can conentrate on the outside of the membrane the more ATP we can make when they come back in via facilitated  diffusion. </p>
<p>How many ATP we can make from each NADH then depends on how many H+ ions are transferred. It turns out that NADH can move 3 H+ ions as the electrons pass through the cytochromes. In the case of FADH, it can only move 2 H+ ions. Therfore each <strong>NADH makes 3 ATP</strong> and <strong>FADH make 2 ATP</strong>. </p>

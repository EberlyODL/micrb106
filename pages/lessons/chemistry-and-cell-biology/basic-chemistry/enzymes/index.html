<p>Enzymes are proteins specifically shaped to carry out special functions in cells:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They accelerate the rate of chemical reactions necessary for life.</li>
	<li>A cell needs many enzymes as each specific metabolic reaction needs a specific enzyme.</li>
	<li>Any changes in their shape will effectively stop chemical reactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Proper protein function depends on correct 3D structure. This is especially important for enzyme activity:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enzymes are vital to proper cell function.</li>
	<li>Defects include sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.</li>
</ul>
<p>Enzymes take a<strong> Substrate</strong> and convert it into a new <strong>Product</strong>.</p>

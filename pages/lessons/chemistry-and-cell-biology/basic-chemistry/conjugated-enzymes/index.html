<p>Sometimes enzymes will not function properly without some extra components. Such enzymes are called c<strong>onjugated enzymes</strong>. These extra items are called <strong>cofactors</strong> which may consist of another protein working as an enzyme itself or an inorganic element like iron, magnesium or zinc. These metallic cofactors help bring the active site and the substrate of the enzyme together so a product can be formed.  </p>

<p>Many times these cofactors are derived from vitamins which is why they are important to the nutrition of the cell. Vitamin deficiencies can inhibit these enzymes and the work that they do inside the cell.</p>

<p>Proteins are made by building long chains of <strong>amino acids</strong>. The Amino acid structure includes an R side chain that is attached to the central carbon, with each R side chain having a different structure to it.</p>

<p>There are twenty different types of side chains (amino acids), as shown below:</p>

<p>The following are characteristics of amino acids:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Amino acids are linked together to form long chains.</li>
	<li>Linked together by<strong> Peptide bonds</strong> a special covalent bond found in proteins.</li>
	<li>Proteins are sometimes called<font color="#cc0033"><strong> </strong></font><strong>Polypeptides</strong><font color="#cc0033"><strong>.</strong></font></li>
	<li>After the chains of Amino acides are constructed, they can fold into more complex structures.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Four Levels of Protein Structure</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Primary:</strong> exact sequence of amino acids before folding.</li>
	<li><strong>Secondary:</strong> simple folding creates simple structures (coils and sheets).</li>
	<li><strong>Tertiary:</strong> folding results in complex 3D structures.</li>
	<li><strong>Quaternary:</strong> multiple 3D subunits organized into a bigger structure.</li>

	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example: Hemoglobin</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Carries oxygen in the blood; it is made up of four specific 3D subunits.</li>
	<li>Proper protein function depends on correct 3D structure.</li>
	<li>Any change in the specific primary structure can cause the protein to fold differently.</li>
	<li>A different shape can lead to a different function (or lack of proper function).</li>
	<li>Sickle cell anemia is an example of a disease caused by an improperly folded hemoglobin protein.</li>
</ul>

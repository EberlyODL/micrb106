<p>There are several mechanisms that allow cells to move things in or out of a cell even if they cannot cross the membrane by themselves.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Simple diffusion (including osmosis)</li>
	<li>Facilitated diffusion</li>
	<li>Active transport</li>
</ol>

<h2>Simple Diffusion</h2>
<p>This transport mechanism takes advantage of the principle of diffusion. Molecules will only move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Therefore, the molecule gradient must be set up to go the desired direction. There must be a high concentration outside the cell and a lower concentration inside the cell before anything will enter the cell.</p>
<p>Also, the molecule must be capable of crossing the membrane on it's own. Recall that only non-polar molecules can do this. <em><strong>No ATP energy is required for simple diffusion</strong></em>.</p>

<h2>Facilitated Diffusion</h2>
<p>This transport mechanism also takes advantage of the principle of diffusion. It is used in cases where the molecule of interest cannot pass through the membrane on it's own. An example would be the sodium ion; Na+. If there is a concentration gradient, which is needed for diffusion, the only extra requirement is finding a mechanism for getting the ion thorough the membrane. This can occur if a specially designed <strong>protein channel</strong> or pore is inserted into the membrane. The protein functions something like a door that the Na+ can pass through.</p>
<p>No energy is needed, the rules of diffusion get the ions to move from one side to another. The only catch is, there's a need for a differently designed protein for each and every different kind of molecule that needs to cross the membrane. Proteins can be built in any shape desired. Differently shaped channels are required for say, all the different ions available. One channel for Na+, another for Ca+ and yet another one for K+.</p>

<h2>Active Transport</h2>
<p align="left">Active Transport is another method cells use to move things across the membrane. A transport protein is also used and different proteins are needed for all the different molecules that are moved through the membrane. This mechanism also requires the input of energy stored in ATP. Every time a molecule is passed through the membrane an ATP is used up. This will allow the cell to transport things across the membrane even if the concentration gradient is backwards.</p>
<p>For example, a cell would like to have more amino acids inside but the concentration is already high. Still the cell needs even more and we can't use diffusion. Diffusion would tend to allow the amino acids to leave the cell, not enter. The cell needs to move the amino acids against the concentration gradient. Using the ATP and active transport allows the cell to increase stored of amino acids even if there is more stored inside the cell than outside.</p>

<p>It's a bit like trying to get water out of a basement. It's raining and water is running into the basement through cracks in the wall. How do you get the water out? Just bring in a water pump, plug it in, and pump the water up and out of the basement against the gradient of gravity. Sometimes we refer to the proteins used in active transport as Pumps. An example is the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.</p>

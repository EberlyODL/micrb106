<p>The physical boundary of any cell is the plasma membrane. It encloses the fluid environment, or <strong>cytoplasm,</strong> found on the inside of all cells. The membrane is made up of a double layer of <strong>phospholipids</strong> arranged in a certain pattern. Phospholipids have<span style="color: rgb(139, 69, 19);"><em><strong> </strong></em></span><em><strong>both </strong></em><strong>polar head groups</strong> and <strong>non-polar tails.</strong> This makes the molecule a bit neurotic when it&#39;s placed into water. One of the only stable formations is a phospholipid bilayer. When a bilayer is formed, the polar head groups are placed on the outside near water, while the non-polar tails are on the inside.</p>

<h2>Proteins</h2>
<p>Embedded in the phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane are many different kinds of <strong>proteins</strong>.</p>
<p>These proteins serve a variety of important functions. Two of the most important functions are cell signaling and membrane transport. <strong>Cell signaling</strong> is important in regulating and controlling the activities of the organ systems of the body. Insulin is a signaling protein that binds to proteins in the membrane of cells and helps to control glucose levels in the blood. When this signaling process is not functioning properly, diabetes results.</p>
<p>The other function of cell membrane proteins involves <strong>cell transport</strong>. It is vital to regulate the flow of nutrients across the plasma membrane. Cells need to control what enters or leaves the cytoplasm.</p>

<h2>Selectively Permeable Membrane</h2>
<p>Since a large portion of the membrane is made up of the nonpolar regions of phospholipids, many things cannot easily cross from one side to the other. This makes the membrane <strong>Selectively Permeable.</strong> Anything that is non-polar will have&nbsp;no problem passing through the membrane. Things like alcohol or steriods are non-polar and can freely cross the membrane. However, anything that is particularly large or strongly polar will not be able to pass through the non-polar region of the membrane. Remember,&nbsp;<em><strong>Polar and non-polar compounds do not mix</strong></em>. Things that do not cross the membrane include large molecules like carbohydrates or amino acids or small molecules with charges, like ions.</p>
<p>Water is an exception to these rules. Water is a polar molecule. It is, however, weakly polar and is also relatively small. Therefore water can in fact freely cross the membrane.</p>

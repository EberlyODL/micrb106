<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve seen that water can cross the membrane of cells on it&#39;s own. However, cells have water on the inside and are also surrounded by water in the body. Why would water bother to cross the membrane even though it easily can? The flow of water from one side of the membrane to the other is called <strong>Osmosis</strong>. The force that drives water to move one direction or another across the membrane is called <strong>Osmotic Pressure</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cells have membranes that allow some things to easily cross, while other things cannot cross without help. The membrane is selectively permeable. Water reacts to the concentration of other molecules trapped on one side of a membrane or the other. Water tends to flow towards the side with the higher concentration.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The picture below shows a glass container of water. There is a membrane at the bottom of the container that prevents glucose from moving to the other side. This mimics what a cell membrane would do. The side with the glucose represents the environment inside a cell. The environment on the other side represents the environment outside the cell. We have a concentration gradient of glucose. According to the laws of diffusion the glucose should move from one side to the other, but it cannot. How can we equalize this concentration imbalance?</p>

<h3 style="text-align: justify; ">Recall concentration is dependant on two things:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. the amount of the substance, and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. the size of the container.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To make something less concentrated we either remove some of the material from the container or we add space to the container. Either way we make things less concentrated or more dilute.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Think of water as having some deep psychological need to make our situation balanced. Since we can&#39;t remove glucose or spread it out, the only solution is to add more water to the side of the container that has the high glucose level. Thus, water moves from one side to the other in an effort to make the glucose concentration more dilute. This pretend psychological impulse of water to move towards the higher concentration is called Osmotic pressure.</p>

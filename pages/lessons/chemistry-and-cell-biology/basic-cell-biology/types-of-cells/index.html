<p align="justified">A cell is the most basic structure of all living things. There are different kinds of cells. Some are relatively simple and others are fairly complex. <strong>Procaryotic</strong> cells like simple bacteria are not highly complex cells. <span><strong>Eucaryotic</strong></span> cells, on the other hand, are far more complex. They have many specialized internal structures called <strong>organelles</strong>. Animals and plants are made up of Eucaryotic cells.</p>
<h2>Viruses</h2>
<p align="justified">One of the simplest living organisms is a <strong>virus</strong>. They are the simplest living organism in that they have the fewest components. In fact, a virus cannot even replicate itself on its own. Viruses are considered <strong>obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. They must first gain access to a host cell where they use the internal machinery of the host cell to replicate itself. This presents interesting problems for the immune system which will be discussed later.</p>

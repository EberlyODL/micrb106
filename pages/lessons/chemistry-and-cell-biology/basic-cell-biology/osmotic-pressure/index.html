<p>Cells can find themselves in <em><strong>3 different situations</strong></em> regarding osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>They can be in:</p>
<ol>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">A solution where there is an <em><strong>equal concentration</strong> of solute inside and outside the cell.</em></li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">A solution where the solute concentration is <em><strong>much higher</strong> outside the cell than inside</em>.</li>
	<li style="text-align: justify;">A solution where the solute concentration is <em><strong>much lower</strong> outside the cell than inside</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Isotonic</strong>: An isotonic solution is one where the solute concentration is perfectly balanced. There is no need for water to move into or out of the cell. The cell will not change shape in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Hypertonic:</strong> In this situation the cell is in a high salt environment outside the cell. This means that osmotic pressure tends to make water move out of the cell as the solute concentration is higher outside compared to the inside. As water moves out of the cell, it makes the cell shrink and inhibits its activity.</p>
<p><strong>Hypotonic</strong>: In this situation the cell is in a low salt environment outside the cell. This means that osmotic pressure tends to make water move into the cell as the solute concentration is higher inside compared to the outside. As water moves into the cell it begins to swell and may actually burst.</p>
